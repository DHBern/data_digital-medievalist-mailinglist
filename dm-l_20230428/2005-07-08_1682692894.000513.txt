Subject: Re: [dm-l] FontsThe MUFI Project website (<http://helmer.aksis.uib.no/mufi/>) has links to
sites of font designers and digital typographers working on fonts with
medieval glyphs.They're at The font page (<http://helmer.aksis.uib.no/mufi/fonts.html>) but
it might be interesting to check out the whole project.We are currently working on a first proposal of medieval characters (or
characters for medievalists) to be presented to the Unicode Consortium.
