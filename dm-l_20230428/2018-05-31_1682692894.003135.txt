Subject: [dm-l] MA in Digital and Computational Humanities tf-8?q?(Univ?
Dear colleagues,

Last year, I annouced you the opening of a new MA in Digital and Computational Humanities at Paris Sciences & Lettres University. After its first year of existence, I am glad to announce that we are recruiting students again for next year. We would be very glad to receive applications from students with a background in medieval studies, a field strongly present in the institutions that participate to this degree (École des chartes, École pratique des hautes études, École des hautes études en sciences sociales and École normale supérieure).

This degree is research-oriented, and aims to be at the intersection of the humanities and data science. Students follow half their courses in the field of the humanities in which they specialise themselves (we have classes on a great variety of subjects, from palaeography, diplomatics, philology, codicology, epigraphy, to historical anthropology or economic history, and a variety of geographic and linguistic areas, from Latin to Hebrew or medieval Hindi). In the other half of their courses, we teach them data manipulation, programming (Python, R), deep learning, statistics and mathematical modelling.

The deadline for application is the 29 june 2018, with a possible second row of applications  in september.

The English prospectus can be found at: http://www.chartes.psl.eu/sites/default/files/atoms/files/flyer-master-humanites-anglais_0.pdf

And more information here: http://www.chartes.psl.eu/en/cursus/ma-digital-humanities

Most courses are in French, and a familiarity of the  applicants with the language is advised, though there are some opportunities for students to follow  courses of French as a foreign language. 

Do not hesitate to forward to anyone that might be interested.

Best wishes,
Jean-Baptiste Camps
