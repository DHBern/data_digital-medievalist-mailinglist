Subject: Re: [dm-l] DM Facebook Group and Twitter Feed

I agree with both Dot and Gabriel... the point of my comparison to the 
early days of listservs was not that twitter needs similar controls 
(moderation, etc.), but that it is a new type of communication that 
participants are still learning to understand and for which etiquette is 
still developing.  The fact is that people do misunderstand how the 
feeds work. I can't see them stopping. But that doesn't mean that people 
won't find them intimidating or assign responsibility to the 
organisation being tweeted about.

I was shocked at the TEI to learn that people find contributing to 
listservs intimidating (I seem to have been born without that gene). But 
they report that they do. I don't think that there is anything to be 
done about twitter feeds or that one ought to do something about them 
(other than perhaps encourage people to be kind to each other). But it 
seems to me still a fact for any organisation that is trying to 
encourage inclusiveness and openness that people who are already 
intimidated by contributing in a public form are likely to find the 
twitter conference even more so. Over time everybody will (have to) get 
used to it, of course, because it is inescapable (and quite useful).
