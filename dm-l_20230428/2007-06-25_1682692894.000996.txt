This Friday's seminar in the Digital Classicist/ICS Work in Progress 
Summer Series is:

Professor Michael Fulford (Reading)
'Silchester Roman Town: developing virtual research practice'

Time: Friday 29 June at 16:30
Place: Room NG16 Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU

Brief abstract:
The Silchester Roman Town Life Project is experimenting with new 
digital approaches to the capture of data from the excavation and to 
the subsequent analysis and publication of the stratigraphic record and
its associated sets of material and biological finds.  The overarching 
aim is to speed up the process between excavation in the field and 
subsequent publication, including the more effective integration of the
research team into the publication programme.

All are welcome. 
The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments after which 
everyone is also welcome to join us in entertaining the speaker at a 
local venue.

Best regards
Simon
