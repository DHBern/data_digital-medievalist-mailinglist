Subject: Re: [dm-l] e-sequence - a multimedia edition

Dear Michael, some years ago Sam Barrett (Cambridge University) for the 
digital edition of the "Corpus Rhythmorum Musicum" (partial version in 
www.corimu.unisi.it) has invented a kind of alphanumeric transcription of 
neumes  and neumatic melodies that is searchable by the software and by 
every search engine. It isn't a standard, but a practical way to encode 
neumes.(see Neume table under Tables Menu).
Best wishes

Neven and others,

Last I looked MEI (and MusicXML) could not be used to handle neumes, as 
these were pitch-based rather than sign-based.

The only system for encoding neumes that I know of is Louis Barton's "Neume 
Notation Project," which is XML based  I don't know if this is ready for 
prime time yet.  You can find info at the following URL:

Kate Helsen and others are working on a neume transcription project (neume 
capture from digital images) as well, although I don't know how far along 
they are on this.  I am working on a similar project that intersects these 
two, although progress will depend on me getting release time next year to 
focus on this.

Michael
