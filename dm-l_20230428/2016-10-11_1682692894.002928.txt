Innovative Modes and Tactics of Literacy in the Humanities 
The Department of English at UCLA invites applications for an Assistant Professor or early Associate Professor specializing in innovative methodologies and approaches that address new or developing modes and tactics of literacy in the humanities. Approaches might include the study of new media formats, computational analysis and machine learning, or research on hypermedia, social media, critical data literacy, visual and aural literacies, techno-literacy, or the writing and reading of virtual worlds. We are especially interested in interdisciplinary scholarship linking the humanities to other areas of inquiry, and critical approaches addressing questions of political economy, social ecology, race, and gender.
