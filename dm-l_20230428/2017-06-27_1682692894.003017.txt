Subject: [dm-l] New MA in Digital and Computational Humanities at Paris

/With apologies for cross-posting/

Dear colleagues,

We are glad to announce the opening of a new MA in Digital and Computational Humanities at Paris Sciences & Lettres Research University. 

This degree is research-oriented. It is for students from the Humanities or Social Sciences wanting to develop their skills in computational methods (programming, quantitative methods, modeling, artificial intelligence) and in their respective fields. It is open to a variety of subjects, ranging from History or Anthropology, to Philology, Linguistics or Literature, in ancient and modern languages (not only European). It associates the École des chartes, École pratique des hautes études, École normale supérieure and École des hautes études en sciences sociales.

Medieval scholarship is well represented in these four institutions, and we would be very glad to receive applications from students wanting to work in any area of Medieval Studies. 

The deadline for next year is close (3 July 2017), but, if someone wishing to apply is afraid of lacking time to make the deadline, he or she can write to me in advance.

The English prospectus can be found at: http://www.enc-sorbonne.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/flyer-master-humanites-anglais.pdf
