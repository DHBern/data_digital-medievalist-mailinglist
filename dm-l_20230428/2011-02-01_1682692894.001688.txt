Subject: RE: [dm-l] Teaching the TEI: your practice?

I do agree that how easy or difficult it is to learn a new technology depends to an extent on one's previous experience and knowledge.

But even then, I would be hard-pressed to see how XSLT would be better than Perl or a similar language when it comes to processing data in which which are not essentially to do with formatting XML documents for display.

If I wanted to, say, develop a program to lemmatise text marked up in paragraphs <p>, or parse Roman calendar dates marked up with <date>, is that something for which you would recommend using XSLT? XSLT would easily let you find that data, but I am not sure it would be easy to then process it in XSLT. Not having associative arrays or more complex data structures in XSLT makes that particularly hard, not?

I think it's certainly true that if you're used to a procedural language like Perl, a functional(ish) language like XSLT will seem bizarre.  But I'm not sure XSLT is any stranger than any other programming language to someone without programming experience.

Learning a (another) procedural language might be easier for someone who already learned a procedural language, but I find the way XSLT work so quite straight forward that once you understood how XML works it might be easy to understand XSLT too?! If you learned object oriented programming like Java, XML-processing with XSLT, XPath etc seems to be very similar?
