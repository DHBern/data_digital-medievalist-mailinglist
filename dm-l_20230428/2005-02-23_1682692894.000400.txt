Subject: Re: [dm-l] XML Database

This is not a quick solution, perhaps, but you may want to look at the 
newest release of Saxon (currently 8.3). It seems to have as well 
developed queries as anything, though anything other than very simple 
usage will require some scripting at the very least. The sample file 
from the installation instruction in the manual looks like it is 
database based.

Go to: <http://www.Saxonica.com>, you want the "b" (free) version 
initially. There is a link on the saxonica site to sourceforge where you 
can get the download.
