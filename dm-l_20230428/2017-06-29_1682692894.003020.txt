Subject: Re: [dm-l] Plain text access to medieval manuscripts: 147 volumes

Dear Dominique,

This does indeed look very interesting. I have a couple of 
questions.

First, is the software (or some part of it) used to extract the text 
from the manuscripts going to be released under a free software 
license? While I'm sure there's plenty of domain-specific stuff 
there, I'm also sure it could be very useful to other projects which 
are doing similar things.

I find it so frustrating when large publically funded projects 
funnel their money into proprietary software that can't be further 
developed and built upon by others. c.f. Transkribus. Here's hoping 
you're planning to release the code soon!

Second question, is there a way to access the plain text directly, 
or is there only a search interface at the moment? Having direct 
plain text access can be useful for others to do various further 
analysis on the corpus.

Anyway, great work, looks exciting, congratulations!
