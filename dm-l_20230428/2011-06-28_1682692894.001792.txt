Subject: Re: [dm-l] online bible versions

As for lists of biblical manuscripts, the register of Greek New  
Testament manuscripts (Gregory - Aland, KurzgefaÃŸte Liste) is online  
as part of the New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room (NT.VMR), at:
http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php

For the front door to the VMR, see:
http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/IndexNTVMR.php

A database of Coptic manuscripts is at: http://intf.uni-muenster.de/smr/
Some transcriptions may be found at: http://www.biblia-coptica.com/

I hope soon to increase the list of Latin biblical manuscripts and  
links to images at www.vetuslatina.org

Finally, for the Gospel according to John, don't forget to visit www.iohannes.com

Best wishes,
Hugh Houghton
