Subject: Re: [dm-l] 500 members

Just a quick thought - might it be worth having some sort of (opt-in  
or opt-out, of course) public listing of DM members?  Not that there  
aren't enough social media platforms out there, but there is something  
to the Facebook/ning model of having a visible community.
