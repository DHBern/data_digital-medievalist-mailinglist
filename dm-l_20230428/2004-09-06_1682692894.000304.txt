What a great idea. It may also create software as gaps open up. That's 
what Conal did with Find Glyph: he knocked together a utility for me 
when nobody on TEI-L could think of one. We have couple of final bugs to 
squash in our web site and then it will be up. This seems to me an 
initiative that might work well in a wiki or rss server.
