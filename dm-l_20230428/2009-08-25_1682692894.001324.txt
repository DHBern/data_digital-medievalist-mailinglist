Subject: Re: [dm-l] Cocoon authentication--anybody with experience?

Thanks Martin!

I'm worried that might be too complicated: I've got a really basic 
system in cocoon set up so that researchers on a project can see xml 
files in HTML and people with various skill sets can make changes where 
they are comfortable. The whole thing is updated every couple of minutes 
from a central subversion repository (it is actually all just a clone 
with some teaks of the DM site, reapplied to an editorial project 
[thanks James!]).

I'd be worried about the time involved in learning a new language and 
set of protocols at this early stage in the process, where all we are 
looking for is a way of protecting an otherwise perfectly functioning 
research site. As my stealing everything from DM suggests, it is at this 
moment the quickest, least learning intensive solution I'm looking for.

But then I've never worked with Python, so maybe I'm being crazy.
