Subject: [dm-l] Webpage up-to-date

In preparation for the launch of our new web site (probably early next 
month), I've updated the digital medievalist web page 
<http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/>. The calls for papers for the new 
journal and our two Kalamazoo sessions are posted there. Please feel 
free to pass the link on to anybody you know who might be interested.
