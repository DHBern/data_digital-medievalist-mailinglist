Job Posting: Research Developer (City Witness and Schenker Documents Online)
[Please feel free to pass this message on to any suitable candidates]

The Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London is looking for a technically imaginative and creative research developer to work on two exciting projects: City Witness (which will create an interactive digital atlas of Swansea and 3D visualisations based on eleven witness testimonies describing the hanging of the Welshman William 'Cragh' in the late 13th century) and the well-established Schenker Documents Online project, which is publishing the writings of the twentieth century's leading theorist of tonal music (see http://www.schenkerdocumentsonline.org). 

Technical curiosity and interest in any or all of linked data, web-based visualisation, or web mapping would be a real advantage. Every research project within the department is characterised by innovation, and the successful candidate will be expected to develop technically imaginative, creative, and elegant solutions whilst at the same time sustaining an awareness of best practices and standards compliance.
