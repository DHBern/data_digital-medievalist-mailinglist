Subject: [dm-l] R:  small and large collections

Dear Matija,

Another web resource that you may want to take into account is the Portuguese 
Early Music Database. It allows free and universal access to a large number of 
manuscripts with musical notation written before c. 1650 preserved in many 
different libraries and archives in Portugal and surrounding Spanish locations. 
Every manuscript is given in full-colour reproduction and entered with a 
general description.

>Can you please give any example of a (small) digital collection of 
>manuscript or printed primary sources which, 1) operates as an 
>independent web-portal AND also 2) their data are in some way 
>included/aggregated into some large collection or digital library?
>
>I am particularly interested in what happens as data pass from a "small" 
>into a "large" digital resource? What kind of data are most suitable and 
>frequent object of such aggregation in our area of digital humanities: 
>only meta-data, or also msDesc, digital images, transcriptions? How 
>"visible" is the original small collection after the aggregation? Etc.
>
>I hope this is not an off-topic question. Thank you for any advice,
