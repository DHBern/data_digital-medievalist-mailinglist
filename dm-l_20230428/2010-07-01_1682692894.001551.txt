Subject: [dm-l] book to review ?

The l;atest list of books for review from BCMR, the classical equivalent 
to BMR, has this entry:

> *Bodard, Gabriel and Simon Mahony. Digital research in the study of classical antiquity. Digital research in the arts and humanities. Farnham; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2010. xx, 210 p. $99.95. ISBN 9780754677734.
>    
I suspect there are people on this List who could review it usefully.  
If you haven't done anything for the Bryn Mawr people, here's the 
paragraph they send about how to get books for review:

> The following books are available for review this month. Qualified voluntee_redacted_(a)brynmawr.edu, with their last name and requested author in the subject line. They should state their qualifications (both in the sense of degrees held and in the sense of experience in the field concerned) and explain any previous relationship with the author. Volunteers are expected to have received their PhD. Those still writing their thesis should contact their supervisors to ascertain that a review is appropriate at this time and that the supervisor will vet and stand surety for the review.
