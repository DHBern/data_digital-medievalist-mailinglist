1) International Conference, 1214 September 2016

Illuminated Charters  from the Margins of Two Disciplines to the Core of
Digital Humanities

Conference venue: Vienna, Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv, Minoritenplatz 
1, Dachfoyer

Archivists, art historians, medievalists, digital humanists, friends of
pattern recognition, media studies, and of objects hidden for centuries: 
all these (and many more) are the target audience of our meeting.

We proudly present speakers from Tampa (Florida), England, France and 
Italy as well as Estonia and Georgia. We are honoured that Olivier 
Guyotjeannin (Paris), Elizabeth Danbury (London), Alison Stones 
(Pittsburgh: Public Lecture, 12 September, 7pm), Irmgard Fees (Munich) 
and Francesca Manzari (Rome) have accepted our invitation to present 
papers (programme and abstracts:

<http://illuminierte-urkunden.uni-graz.at/de/tagung-12-1492016/> ).

Much more important, though, is the quality and variety of topics:
discussions about data-modelling, best-practice examples of combined
presentations of image and metadata are highlights of the digital part.
Surveys of regional characteristics (England, Lombardy, Venice, Rome, 
Latvia and Lithuania, Georgia) and in depth-studies of single objects 
are  very intentionally  combined as necessary methodological 
contrast. Studies focusing on archival holdings in specific regions lead 
to papers dealing with chanceries and special types of charters, which 
are regularly decorated with artistic means. These means range from 
graphic signs developing in private charters in St Gall during the 8th 
century to signs characteristic of specific types of charters and highly 
refined artefacts made for famous late medieval collectors, and finally 
to (printed) charters which are equally perfect advertising media.

The organizing team (Gabi Bartz, Martina Bürgermeister, Markus Gneiss,
Martin Roland, Georg Vogeler, Andreas Zajic) is pleased to invite you to
this conference. Due to the limited space available at the Dachfoyer of
the Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv, we kindly ask you to register in time:

Gabi Bartz, Martina Bürgermeister, Markus Gneiss, Martin Roland, Georg
Vogeler and Andreas Zajic have decided  after a peer-reviewing-process 
and internal discussions  to publish first results of the FWF project
Illuminated Charters as ´Gesamtkunstwerk´.

678 illuminated collective indulgences are freely accessible for everyone.
We are well aware that we can only present work in progress. This is 
true for the digital part as well as for the content. Part of the 
indexing work has still to be implemented into the search environment 
and depth of information varies significantly.
Partly this is a deliberate decision, because it does not make sense to 
offer extensive abstracts for poorly decorated objects which are only 
of importance due to their character as forerunners to later, more 
extensively illuminated indulgences. On the other hand there are 
charters which deserve more in-depth treatment, but parts of
the description ([extensive] abstract, diplomatic comment, description 
of decoration and art-historical commentary) are still lacking.
We hope, however, that users are willing to accept such shortcomings in
order to get access more quickly. We want to encourage each and every 
_redacted_(a)gmail.com>
_redacted_(a)gmail.com) such as additions, corrections 
(including typos), hints to additional sources, images or reference 
literature; do not hesitate to point out amendments no matter how small.
