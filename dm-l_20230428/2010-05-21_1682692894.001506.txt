Subject: [dm-l] JSTOR and PDF Sizes (TAN)

Hi have a question somebody here may know the answer to.

A colleague of mine is scanning back issues of journal she edits for 
online publication. She is using PDF with OCR to provide full-text 
searchability a la JSTOR. The issue is that the file sizes are really 
quite different. A 30pp article from a 1920s issue of Speculum, for 
example, seems to come in about 1.5-2.0 MB; 5-6 page article in my 
colleagues journals are coming in about the same size, and other files 
are well over 4 MB.

I haven't seen the settings used for the scanning or OCR yet, but the 
JSTOR and her files appear to be about the same resolution (eyeballing 
the page size when things are set to 100%). They look like they are 
being scanned in B&W, but I haven't checked (perhaps a colour channel is 
adding to the bulk?). Any other suggestions for things that might be 
causing the files to be abnormally large?
