Subject: [dm-l] Launch of RIDE - Review Journal for Digital Editions

*** Apologies for cross-posting ***

The Institute for Documentology and Scholarly Editing (IDE) is happy  
to announce the launch of a new review journal, RIDE. We aim to make  
digital editions and resources more visible and to provide a forum in  
which expert peers can evaluate and discuss the efforts of digital  
editors in order to improve current practices and advance future  
developments. It will do so by asking its reviewers to pay attention  
not only to the traditional virtues and vices of any edition, but also  
to the evolving methodology and its technical implications.

You can access all reviews at: http://ride.i-d-e.de

You can find out more about the ideas behind RIDE, our methods and  
intentions, in the Editorial at: http://ride.i-d-e.de/about/editorial/

We are also looking for contributions. Please see:

Enjoy the ride!
