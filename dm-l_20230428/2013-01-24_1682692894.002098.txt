Subject: Re: [dm-l] e-sequence - a multimedia edition

Neven and others,

Last I looked MEI (and MusicXML) could not be used to handle neumes, as these were pitch-based rather than sign-based.

The only system for encoding neumes that I know of is Louis Barton's "Neume Notation Project," which is XML based  I don't know if this is ready for prime time yet.  You can find info at the following URL:

Kate Helsen and others are working on a neume transcription project (neume capture from digital images) as well, although I don't know how far along they are on this.  I am working on a similar project that intersects these two, although progress will depend on me getting release time next year to focus on this.
