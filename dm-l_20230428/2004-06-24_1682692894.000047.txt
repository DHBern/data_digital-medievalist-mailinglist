Subject: Re: [dm-l] Useful free tools for finding unicode characters

For MacOS X, there's UnicodeChecker, a handy piece of freeware
available at: http://www.earthlingsoft.net/UnicodeChecker/index.html

There are almost certainly others; I'd suggest going to VersionTracker
and doing a search on unicode.
