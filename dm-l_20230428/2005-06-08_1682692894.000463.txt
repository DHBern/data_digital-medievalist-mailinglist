I sent this message to Medtext-l this morning, but it's of interest to this list, too. I've never used HEML, but it looks neat:

Take a look at the Historical Event Markup and Linking Project (http://www.heml.org/). The stated goal of HEML is "to define XML elements that expose and outline historical events asserted in documents across the web and to parse and display these elements in interesting and useful ways." It's a markup system, not software, and you'd probably have to use some XML editing software to create your HEML documents, rather than any HEML-specific software, but it does appear to enable linking to digital objects using the <Evidence> element. 

HEML is designed to be combined with other markup languages, so if you already have your information in some form of XML (a TEI list, for example) you can add HEML markup on top of that using the heml: namespace.

HEML also requires XSLT and/or SVG for viewing. 

This may be more or less than what you need, but check out the example files. They're pretty cool.
