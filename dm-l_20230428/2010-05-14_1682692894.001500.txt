Subject: [dm-l] ApologiesDear List,I want to apologize to everyone who attended the DM-sponsored session
at Kalamazoo yesterday and found it presider-less. James Cummings told
me weeks ago that he would be unable to attend and it was my
responsibility to find a new presider, which (obviously) I did not do.
I understand there was some confusion yesterday and I hope that things
worked out. I'm very, very sorry about this, and I'm especially sorry
that it reflects poorly on James, and on the Digital Medievalist, when
the fault was entirely with me.Dot--
