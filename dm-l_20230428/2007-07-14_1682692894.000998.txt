Subject: [dm-l] [Fwd: PHD studentship in 3D scanning of museum objects]

FYI

>Funded PhD studentship
>
>E ­Curator: 3D colour scans for remote object identification andassessment
>
>This project draws on UCL's expertise both in 
>curatorship and in e-Science. It takes advantage 
>of the presence at UCL of world class 
>collections across a range of disciplines and of 
>a state of the art colour scanner, the quality 
>of which is unequalled in the UK. The project 
>aims to apply e-science technologies to museum 
>work and artefact analysis, exploring the 
>potential to capture and share in a secure and 
>repeatable manner very large, detailed datasets 
>about museum artefacts, thereby enhancing 
>international scholarship and facilitating the 
>safe movement of artefacts. The ability to share 
>validated 3D colour data could facilitate 
>object-tracking and condition checking, enabling 
>curators and conservators to compare records 
>collected at different institutions and stored 
>remotely, or collected over a period of time 
>under different conditions, in order to assess 
>and monitor change. The project is jointly 
>funded by the Arts and Humanities Research 
>Council (AHRC), the Engineering and Physical 
>Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Joint 
>Information Systems Committee (JISC).
>
>The specific aims of the project are to:
>    * Develop a repeatable methodology for 
> recording the surface detail and colour quality 
> of a range of object types and materials
>    * Explore the potential for producing 
> validated datasets that would allow closer and 
> more scientific examination of groups of 
> objects, the processes involved in their 
> manufacture, and issues of wear and deterioration.
>    * Examine how the resulting datasets could 
> be transmitted, shared and compared.
>    * To begin to build expertise in the use and 
> transmission of 3D scan data as a curatorial tool.
>
>The PhD student will work as part of a team to 
>explore the usage of the developed tools and 
>undertake re-scanning and comparison of the 
>objects on a periodic basis. This work will form 
>the basis of a 4 year PhD investigation of the 
>abilities of 3D colour scanning and e-science 
>based data sharing and visualization for the 
>museum community. The studentship will be 
>supervised by Sally MacDonald, Director of UCL 
>Museums and Collections and will be based in the Institute of Archaeology.
>
>To be eligible for a full award, which covers 
>the cost of tuition fees and a maintenance grant 
>(£14,700 in 2007/8), applicants should be 
>normally resident in the UK.  Applicants should 
>have a good background in museum, material 
>culture, conservation, heritage studies or 
>archaeology at honours degree level (first/upper 
>second), and preferably some post-graduate 
>training or museums experience.  A strong 
>interest in cultural heritage technologies is 
>essential and experience in computing will be an 
>advantage. The studentship must start no later than 1 October 2007.
