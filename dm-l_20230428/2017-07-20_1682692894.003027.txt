*Issues in the development of digital projects based on user 
requirements. The case of Beta maṣāḥǝft*
Dorothea Reule & Pietro Liuzzo (Hamburg)

"Beta maṣāḥǝft: Manuscripts of Ethiopia and Eritrea” aims at building a 
research environment for data related to the Ethiopian and Eritrean 
manuscript tradition, encoding and relating manuscript descriptions, 
editions of literary works and records about ancient and modern places 
and persons. The challenges of meeting data entry users’ needs are 
keeping the schema canonical while enabling all necessary encoding, 
developing visualization choices on an individual basis without twisting 
the guidelines and enabling the execution of some tasks without XML 
knowledge. End users will expect comprehensive information on 
manuscripts, yet the resulting resource catalogue, navigable between 
entities, can be disorienting.
