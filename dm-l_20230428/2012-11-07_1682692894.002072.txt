The cultural act of reading is in flux. The dynamic, contextual 
framework that is the text viewed on screen challenges our understanding 
of the page. Some technologies seek to emulate the page, to turn off the 
back light and enable reading outdoors in sunlight. Other digital 
technologies aim to both sustain and augment the reader’s experience of 
the text, moving beyond the paper page and into a new conceptualisation 
of reading, with layers of texts, with choices of views, with integrated 
multi and social media. This presentation explores how we once read and 
how we now read often multivalent texts on multiple screens. I query 
what has changed in these new modes of knowledge representation, and 
what remains constant, and posit challenges for future scholarly discourse.
