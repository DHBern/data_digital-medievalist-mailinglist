Subject: Re: [dm-l] numbering lines

Abdullah,

I'd second what Notis is suggesting here.  Using a format like:

 >     <L 2>   ðu eart se weallstan         þe ða wyrhtan iu

is really moving backwards in technological development to the 1980s and markup 
languages like COCOA and OCP.  We have lots of stuff in such terrible formats in 
the Oxford Text Archive, and it is a pain to convert.  Using XML, as Notis 
suggests, would allow you to take advantage of all the existing tools for 
creating, manipulating, transforming and querying XML.  You can always transform 
from a TEI XML structure like:

<l n="2">ðu eart se weallstan         þe ða wyrhtan iu</l>

back to

<L 2>   ðu eart se weallstan         þe ða wyrhtan iu

really really easily, if that is how some other input program suggests.

Murray:  To answer your original question, I remember doing something similar in 
emacs eons ago.  (I've given up on emacs and use oxygen for most 
text/script/program files and OO for everything else.)  I can't remember if it 
was a built-in function from some package I had installed, or whether I knocked 
up a bit of elisp to do it.  Let me know if you are desperate to do it this way 
and I can dig back through my old elisp files somewhere.

For the record, the way I would do this now would be one of two ways:
1) For a quick hack where I needed to do it quickly I would add the line numbers 
automatically to the text file in openoffice and then just cut and paste it back 
into my text editor.  (Inefficient I know...)
2) I have an XSLT script which will read in a plain text file and output 
everything in <l> (with a new <lg> for any blank lines between stanzas.

However, I would echo what I'd say to Abdullah above.  *Why* add line numbers? 
The *only* reason really to add line numbers these days is if the line numbering 
is irregular for some reason. (i.e. the text goes 1,2,3,4, *big burnt 
hole*,12,13,14.)  Amazingly, computers are really good at counting, and counting 
lines is easy.  So, mark everything up as <l> and then just number them 
automatically when producing a presentation version.

Just my tuppence,

-James
