Subject: [dm-l] Kalamazoo 2006 session reminder

Hello all,
	Just a reminder to consider posting your digitally-oriented session 
proposals for Kalamazoo 2006 to our wiki page: 
http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Kalamazoo_2006

As discussed at the business meeting, we will try to use this page as a 
lobbying tool to avoid over lap among 'related' sessions. Our goal is to 
provide the organisers with a list of sessions that are complementary 
and hence should not overlap.
