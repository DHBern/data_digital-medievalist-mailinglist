Subject: Re: [dm-l] DTD for Editing Medieval Booklists ?

I don't know of any specific project with a dtd for this problem; but I 
wonder why the TEI guidelines wouldn't work. Between the metadata, 
headers, and text components, is not everything that you need there? I'd 
imagine off the top of my head that you'd encode the catalogue and text 
as a corpus (the text part) and extract material as needed (the database 
part). But perhaps I'm not understanding the problem.
