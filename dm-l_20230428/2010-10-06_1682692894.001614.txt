Subject: Re: [dm-l] TAN: How does one reference a location in an electronic

A possible (additional) problem here is that, with the advent of electronic publications, we might different "versions" of the same edition (that contain the same content).  So unless the Kindle version were the only version, a reference to a Kindle location might not prove very helpful to the reader trying to locate the referenced content (which is at least one of the relatively significant functions of the reference in the first place).

For practical purposes, at the moment anyway, I would be inclined to (at least) supplement any reference to an electronic publication's "location, etc." with page numbers in a physical book.  However, hopefully, by the time we have more exclusively electronic publications, some kinds of standards for referencing sections of material will have been developed -- and implemented.

Cheers,
Carl

A particular word in a particular book, has a particular location independently of the font size (I just checked this). I only have one of my Kindles here, so I cannot check the consistency from system to system, but I suspect (and hope) that this would not vary. Locations vary, however, depending on the edition (in the same way that printed books have passages in different pages in different editions).
