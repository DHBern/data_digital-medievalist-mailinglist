Subject: [dm-l] TEI Conference redux

Hi all,

I was just asked what kind of affiliation one needs to participate in 
the TEI conference. The answer is none at all. This is a digitization 
conference at which TEI members also meet rather than a meeting with 
lectures. We also very much encourage non-TEI-centric views: we 
regularly invite keynote speakers and accept papers that are critical 
of, sceptical of, or otherwise questioning about TEI activities or 
guidelines--or document modelling more generally. The range runs from 
highly technical to quite theoretical, so there should be scope for most 
active Digital Humanists.

So like many academic conferences, there is no need to be a member in 
order to participate. Of course you will have a chance to join the TEI 
at the conference if you wish! We might even let you drink the Koolaid ;)
