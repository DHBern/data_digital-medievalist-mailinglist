Subject: [dm-l] comparisons of different e-MS readers?

Yesterday I attended a planning meaning concerning the Durham priory
library's manuscript collection, which is planned for digitisation
over the next 5-10 years.  A question came up about whether there's
been any study done on the relative *technical* merits of different
platforms/programmes for viewing manuscripts, either online or
downloaded locally.  (The person was specifically interested in reviews
or comparisons done by people with the relevant computational know-
how).

I confess to not being very familiar with this terrain; I've used
Uni-HD's reader online (see, e.g., the Manesse codex:
http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg848/0001?sid=c1e158af8bb04a02441c48d73cfba985)
and the reader used by, e.g.,
http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/0000/bsb00001649/images/, but I
don't even know what the programmes behind these sites are!  The one
that was demonstrated to us is Mirador:
http://www.biblissima-condorcet.fr/en/news/interoperable-viewer-prototype-now-online-mirador, 
http://iiif.io/, and it was really
cool.  I'd love to know how it stacks up against the competition.

Cheers,
-Sara
