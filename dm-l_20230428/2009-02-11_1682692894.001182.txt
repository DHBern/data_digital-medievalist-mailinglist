Subject: [dm-l] How useful are digital resources survey

With apologies for cross posting.

Dear all,

The Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at the University of Oxford, and the 
Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) are currently involved in a 
study of the impact of digital resources in the Humanities.
Contribute your feedback on how you are using digital resources by 
following this link:

http://survey.oii.ox.ac.uk/Collector/Survey.ashx?Name=Use_of_Digital_Resources 

This survey takes most participants under 20 minutes to complete. 
 Your feedback will only reach  OII/JISC  if you reach the end of the 
survey and click 'submit'.

The statistical results will be publicly reported, but all information 
provided by individuals will be anonymized and not tied to any 
individual. If you would like the results of the survey e-mailed to you, 
there will be an opportunity at the end of the survey to provide an 
e-mail address for this purpose.

Many thanks!
