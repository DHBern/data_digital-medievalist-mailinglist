Subject: [dm-l] Relational database and TEIDear all, Does anybody know about electronic manuscript projects which are
using/have used relational databases following the TEI guidelines for
'Manuscript description'?Scriptorium seems to have done it, any other similar project? If so, do
you know of any related publication?I'd be very grateful for any advice, pitfall etc.Best wishes, OriettaDr Orietta Da Rold
