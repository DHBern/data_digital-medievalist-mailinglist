In this paper, I consider how customisable approaches to reconstruction might be able to embrace the multivocality and flexibility needed to aid recovery following conflict. I start with the debate over accuracy concerning the Institute of Digital Archaeologyâ€™s replica Palmyra arch. I argue that, instead, we need to ask why we are creating reconstructions and for whom. I then look at examples from creative practice, including Michael Rakowitz and Morehshin Allahyari, as inspiration for more participatory and flexible reconstructions.
