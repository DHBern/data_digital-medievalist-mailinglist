Why just git? I'm quite happy with mercurial (and BitBucket.org, cf.  
e.g. https://bitbucket.org/jsbien/ndt/wiki/wyniki). This was not my  
own decision, but practically all my collaborators preferred mercurial  
over other version control systems, so I joined them. There is at  
least one multiplatform GUI (TortoiseHg).

Best regards and Happy New Year
