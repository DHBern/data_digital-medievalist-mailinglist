Subject: Re: [dm-l] Use of wikis for transcription

I've not heard of others doing this, but I use wikis for lots of scratch 
collaboration projects. So in principle, this is a reasonable way to 
work informally among a small group on a first pass.

My main caveat about this is that this is probably only suitable for a 
first pass at character capture rather than any serious editorial work, 
and even then it might prove problematic. The main problem is that there 
is no way of automatically enforcing a policy on what is to be captured 
or how these details are to be recorded: if you have multiple people 
working on a project, and you have no control over what they enter, they 
will invariably diverge in practice: one scholar might expand 
abbreviations, another prefer to leave them unexpanded; one might record 
multiple options for reading difficult passages, another just choose the 
most likely, and yet others use different symbols for indicating 
uncertainty. Same is true of damage or codicological features: one 
scholar might want to record information about the damage down in lines 
38 or so and ff.; another might just transcribe around the cut and damage.

A solution around this might be to insist that encoders use something 
like the Leiden system of diplomatic transcription symbols although you 
won't have anyway of enforcing correct use.

XML and XML tools like the OxygenXML editor are designed precisely to 
give you this kind of control. There was a time when they could seem 
quite intimidating. Nowadays, however, they are becoming ever more user 
friendly. So one, slightly more formal way, of setting a project up so 
that more than one person could transcribe texts might be to ask 
everybody to get a copy of something like OxygenXML (although in 
principle, it wouldn't matter what editor they used), and then store 
their common transcriptions online in a version control repository like 
subversion. People would work on transcriptions on their home computers 
and then log the files back into the common repository when they were 
finished. Subversion logs changes and lets more than one person work on 
the same file at the same time. And you can show the world what you are 
doing by also publishing the repository (this is how Digital Medievalist 
works, in fact: we have a subversion repository with all the XML files. 
This repository is copied to a non-public website (so we can check our 
work) once every minute or two and then to the public site once a day. 
Individual editors download files to edit from the central repository).

The above assumes that your plan is to have a group of previously 
identified editors work on the same project (negotiated collaboration). 
If your goal instead is crowd sourcing (i.e. just putting MS images and 
or transcriptions up and letting anybody transcribe or edit them, then 
you'll need some other solution. But planning that depends on what you 
see the goal of the project as: if it is really just to get the text out 
of the manuscript photos and into unicode characters, then a wiki might 
work--but I'd say ask people only to record the letters in front of 
them, perhaps making a policy of expanding abbreviations, and not to 
record any paleographic features, uncertainty, etc. Other solutions 
might depend on what you want to crowd source. For example, if you have 
an XML encoded document that you are displaying on the web, it could be 
possible to code the page so that people could click on a word they want 
to correct, and then get the content of the word (but not the tags) 
displayed to them in a little form window for correction. And then you 
could go up to much more heavily programmed solutions.

Bottom line: a wiki is a good informal way of sharing work (with loss of 
policy control) or for crowdsourcing very simple questions (are these 
the right letters? what letters does this image contain?). But for 
really encoding expert knowledge or doing anything complicated with the 
text at all, you are going to want to use XML. There are very robust 
ways of doing that in a distributed fashion.
