We used to teach this here, but found demand was dropping as more and 
more of the "digital natives" came on stream.

They would be right. On the other hand, there's no reason why the same 
course could not be customized to impart the same skills using e.g. Open 
Office. It should be all about transferable skills, surely!

Now there's a distinction worth unpacking. I assume that "desktop" 
packages are also the same as the things I use on my laptop, so what 
exactly are "generic" IT skills? command line abilities? knowing about 
the hardware? programming? project management? systems analysis and 
database design? These seem a bit ambitious for such a course!
