Two short presentations:

1) *The role of Digital Humanities in Papyrology: Practices and user 
needs in papyrological research*
Lucia Vannini (Institute of Classical Studies)

The development of digital tools and methods has led to significant 
changes to traditional research in the Humanities, affecting scholars’ 
ways of organising and analysing information. Also, the wish to support 
researchers’ new needs has consequently grown: examinations of their 
practices have been conducted in order to build efficient and usable 
resources. This presentation focuses on the information I have gathered, 
through interviews and user observations, on the behaviour of 
papyrologists in the digital age: on their practices involved in 
searching digital collections, in the use and management of their data, 
and in the creation of new knowledge.

2) *Cultural Contact in Early Roman Spain through Linked Open Data 
resources*
Paula Granados García (Open University)

Although the Romanisation debate seems to be settled in English-language 
scholarship, other countries, such as Spain, have only just started to 
revise traditional discourses. During the 1900s, Spanish studies on 
Romanisation focused mainly on documentation of the immense amount of 
evidence from the Imperial perspective. This work is being re-examined 
through new methodologies and perspectives. Novel initiatives are 
emerging that aim to look at this cultural encounter from the eyes of 
the colonised. My research explores the possibilities offered by Linked 
Open Data and the Semantic Web to connect, share and make available 
large amounts of data regarding the question of cultural interaction.
