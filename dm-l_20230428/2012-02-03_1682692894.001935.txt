>>
>> After careful consideration, Brill has taken the initiative of
>> designing a typeface. Named â€œthe Brillâ€, it presents complete
>> coverage of the Latin script with the full range of diacritics and
>> linguistics (IPA) characters used to display any language from any
>> period correctly, and Greek and Cyrillic are also covered. There are
>> over 5,100 characters in all. This indispensable tool for scholars
>> will become freely available later this year for non-commercial use.
>> You will be able to download the font package after agreeing to the
>> End User License Agreement. â€œThe Brillâ€ is available in roman,
>> italic, bold, and bold italic, with all necessary punctuation marks
>> and a wide assortment of symbols. It will be especially welcomed by
>> humanities scholars quoting from texts in any language, ancient or
>> modern. â€œThe Brillâ€ complies with all international standards,
>> including Unicode. John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks, well-known for his
>> multilingual fonts, is the Brillâ€™s designer.
