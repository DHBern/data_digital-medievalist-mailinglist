Subject: [dm-l] Oops: forgot the linkForgot the link to the page I meant:<http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php/Convert_character_references>.BTW: if anybody is interested in keeping track of changes to the Wiki, 
it is possible to receive recent edits and editions as a news feed. You 
log in, go to recent changes, and add the RSS link to your favorite 
reader. The DM main site news feed isn't working today for some reason. 
I've asked the boffins.
