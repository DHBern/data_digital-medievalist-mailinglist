Subject: RE: [dm-l] Open Office and Word

Dear Dan,

OO can both open and save files in Word format, although some of the more esoteric new formatting found in Office 2007 is not preserved when the file is opened in OO, even in the latest version, OO 3.0.1. 

As far as I know, Word cannot handle files in OO format. There are projects to create converters and add-ins to enable Word to handle OO files, but they don't seem to be ready yet.

There is lots of info on http://www.openoffice.org/ .
