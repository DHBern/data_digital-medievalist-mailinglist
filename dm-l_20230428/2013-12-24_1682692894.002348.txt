Subject: [dm-l] Announcing the Digital Vercelli Book (beta)

After years of hard work, the Digital Vercelli Book is now online! This 
is a beta version though, lacking several features that will be present 
in the final edition, scheduled for publication in 2014. At the moment 
only two texts, The Dream of the Rood and Homily 23, are available: the 
plan is to improve the current user interface and software on the basis 
of the suggestions and comments that will be sent to us, publish the 
revised software at some point next year and then progressively put 
online all the texts after a final cross-revision has been accomplished.
