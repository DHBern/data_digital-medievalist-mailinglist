I find blogs not the right tool for community-building -- and possibly also becoming a bit old fashioned!

Me too. :)  But an arrangement that combines, or offers options of either, mailing-list and forum interfaces (e.g. Yahoo and Google Groups both do this, more or less) seems all right. Likewise, a forum that sends me email alerts about new posts or replies is OK.

Cheers,
