Subject: RE: [dm-l] what xslt can't do..?

I agree with James (mind if we call you Peter, just to keep things
clear?) that a multi-pass approach is likely to be more efficient than
mine, just because of the overhead mine incurs in creating nodesets all
the time. What my approach needs is a function that takes a node-set and
returns a tree fragment containing those nodes and all their ancestors,
with non-ancestors stripped out. Does XSLT2 provide such a function? I
haven't got into 2 yet. If not, it probably wouldn't be too hard to
write up a Java extension to do it.

For situations requiring the kind of performance that Peter Robinson is
talking about, XSLT will probably always have value only as a
prototyping tool, to be replaced by coded projects like Peter's. But I
think it has more value as a prototyping tool than Peter R. is giving it
credit for. I think a better Java programmer than me (i.e. any Java
programmer) would still have taken longer than I did to prototype a
solution to Peter's challenge, and would have required more than 63
lines of code to do it.
