With two of you away it doesn't make sense to have it that day.

Here is a link to a doodle poll.  Hopefully enough of you will be
available during the second week of august instead? I've done a doodle
poll of August 8 - 12th.

The times are 4pm, 5pm, 6pm using London Time, however, If it can pick
up your timezone from your browser it should display them in your
local time. (Let me know if it works, or conversely, if it doesn't!)

Expand all 5 days.
