Subject: [dm-l] New version of EVT 2 released

EVT 2 beta 1, aka "The Halloween release", is available for download 
with many new features: improved support for critical editions (critical 
apparatus also available in a dedicated text frame, apparatus fontium, 
support for multiple recensions), initial support for named entities, 
initial support for a working area, and more. As for previous versions 
the starting point is a TEI P5 document holding your critical or 
diplomatic edition, support for the latter is still incomplete since the 
EVT 1 features porting is currently under way.

Full announcement available here:

As usual, the latest archive can be downloaded from SourceForge:
