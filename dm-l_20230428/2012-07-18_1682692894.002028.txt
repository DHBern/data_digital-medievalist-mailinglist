Subject: Re: [dm-l] Getting Latin Spell Check for Word 2011 ON A MAC

Dear Dr Witt,

You might also be interested to know that there is a way to install
the OpenOffice/LibreOffice Latin dictionary system-wide in Mac OS X
(i.e. in Mail, TextEdit, BBEdit, etc., though it doesn't apply to
Word). Change the extension of the OpenOffice file to zip (it's
actually an archive), uncompress it, and place the aff and dic files
in Library/Spelling/. This works for any Hunspell dictionary. (For
Latin, be sure to get either the 'universal' or 'classical' version,
depending on what you want: see the read me within the archive.)

All best,

Andrew Dunning
