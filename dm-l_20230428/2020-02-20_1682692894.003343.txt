Subject: [dm-l] Digital Classicist London seminar call for papers

Digital Classicist London invites proposals for the summer 2020 seminar, which will run on Friday afternoons through June and July at the Institute of Classical Studies, Senate House.

To submit a paper, please email an abstract of up to 300 words as an attachme_redacted_(a)sas.ac.uk by Sunday, March 29, 2020. (Include the words “Digital Classicist seminar” in the subject line to be sure of not being missed!)

Proposals from researchers of all levels, including students, practitioners and academics, are equally welcome. We would like to see papers that address digital, innovative and collaborative research, teaching and practice in all areas of antiquity (including cultures beyond the Mediterranean), from classics, ancient history, cultural heritage, reception, or other perspectives. As with previous years, presentations will be live-cast and archived on Youtube. There is a small budget to assist with travel to London (usually from within the UK, but partial reimbursement for longer trips may be possible).

Organizers:
   Gabriel Bodard (Institute of Classical Studies)
   Paula Granados García (Open University)
   Eleanor Robson (University College London)
   Simona Stoyanova (University of Nottingham)
   Valeria Vitale (Institute of Classical Studies)
