Subject: Re: [dm-l] Best practices for "scholar's own" digitization?

The HumSlides project at King's migrated its image collection to Flickr 
when the license for the management system it was hosted on expired. The 
images were originally digitised from 35mm slides used for teaching and 
research in the Classics and BMGS depts. As much was legacy material 
with no clear provenance the College was not willing to make these 
openly available and so they are sitting there on Fickr in a password 
protected account.

Password protected = not used.

I plan to start another copyright free collection on Flickr when I can 
find the time. Could this be the start of a collaborative project?
