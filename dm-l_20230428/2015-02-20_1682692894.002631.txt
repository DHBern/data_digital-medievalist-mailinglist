Subject: Re: [dm-l] comparisons of different e-MS readers?

The E-codices project is wonderful; also note that thereâ€™s a rather neat iOS viewer at <http://e-codices.textandbytes.com>. Also among my favourites are the online materials developed by the Distributed Digital Music Archives and Libraries Lab at McGill:

http://cantus.simssa.ca

http://salzinnes.simssa.ca

The underlying script has a website at <http://ddmal.github.io/diva.js/>.

As a user, my only request is that you make it easy to download the original image files. The best online viewer in the world is useless when one is transcribing a manuscript on the train!

All best,

Andrew Dunning
