Subject: [dm-l] A new typeface that might be of interest to medievalists, or

A librarian here just passed on a note to me that Brill have opened
access to their new typeface. It is supposedly full of IPA and
diacritics as well as Greek and Cyrillic.

We all know the type of thing Brill publish, so one might expect it to
be grundlich, even if I haven't seen it yet myself.

> humanities scholars quoting from texts in any language, ancient or
> modern. â€œThe Brillâ€ complies with all international standards,
> including Unicode. John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks, well-known for his
> multilingual fonts, is the Brillâ€™s designer.
