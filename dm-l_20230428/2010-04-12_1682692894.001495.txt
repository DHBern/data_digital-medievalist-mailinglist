Subject: [dm-l] Number 5,169,396th with a bullet

Lou Burnard posted a nibbler ranking of tei-c.org on tei-l. So I thought 
I'd run DM. Some issues appeared, but I did like discovering that we are 
5,169,396th most popular in the world and that "This website recently 
saw a significant increase in popularity."
