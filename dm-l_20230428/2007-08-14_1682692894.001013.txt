Hi Jim,

Although they aren't really intended to do what you want (and I'm interested in 
other answers you might receive), have you considered some of the corpus 
linguistic analysis software out there?  It would involve having all the 
sources, of course, in the corpus but then indicating that one text uses a 
particular text more than another seems fairly straightforward.  However, as 
with all such things having the texts with detailed descriptive markup would be 
even more beneficial.  I can't think of anything which would do exactly what you 
want out-of-the-box.
