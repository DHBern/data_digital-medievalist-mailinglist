Subject: Re: [dm-l] Are markup languages obsolete?

1) a lot of people I know would be very happy working with a good 
facsimile, or would not want a critical edition that changed the 
manuscript readings in any way. (In fact, I know a lot of theorists [not 
I] who hold that monkeying with the reading of an Ms is unwarranted 
intrusion to keep the profession alive and 'needed')

2)  no one asked us to play a role in the development of writing 
systems, or printing, or typewriters, or book production. One could 
argue that this time we are lucky to have a hand in the development of 
computer methods - but one could just as easily argue that there is no 
more reason for us to do that than there was when those other methods of 
textual communication were being developed....
