Subject: Re: [dm-l] DM-Board Election Results

Dear all,

I’d like to take this opportunity to officially welcome Alberto, Franz and Georg to the DM Board, and to welcome back Alexei for a second term. I’d also like to thank our outgoing members, Orietta da Rold, Takako Kato and Timoty Leonardi, for all their many contributions to DM over the last two or four years. Thanks also to Dominique and Ben for running the elections this year.

Regarding restructuring, things have been on hold a bit due to the elections and to being ‘conference season’ and summer vacation, but work on this will resume again shortly, with more news to follow.

Please also keep in mind that there are many ways that you can all contribute to DM, even if not through formal Board membership. There are a lot of small but essential roles that need to be covered, such as the journal, Facebook admin, mailing-list admin, Twitter feed, website management (admin and content), wiki/blog management, organising and running conference sessions, and more. These roles are typically handled by Board members, but if anyone else wants to be involved then please do get in touch. Suggestions are also very welcome of new things you would like us to do are very welcome as well.

All the best,

Peter
