Subject: Re: [dm-l] Character reference conversions: help?

For those of us not comfortable with XSLT, any editor designed to
work with unicode text (e.g. UniPad, BabelPad) should be able
to convert to and from numeric character references (decimal or hex), 
UTF-8 (little- or bigendian), UTF-16, and (my favorite) 'java unicode 
escapes' (aka UCNs). UniPad is pricey; BabelPad, I think, is free.
Ideally also from and to ISO standard SGML SDATA character entities. Such 
editors, however, usually work on one file at a time, rather than as a 
batch-mode filter.

For the latter purpose, Perl should do the trick: the only filters I 
use locally go the wrong direction (either from named entities to UTF-8 or
from UTF-8 to UCNs), but there are a couple of scripts posted
_redacted_(a)nl.linux.org/msg02741.html
that look like they should work; if not, there are undoubtedly
others out there that will. I think all it has to do is parse
&...; strings and convert them to UTF-8 characters, but what would
I know?
