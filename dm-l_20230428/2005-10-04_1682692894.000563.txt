Subject: [dm-l] procite databaseDear colleagues,I hope someone can help me out with a query; I hope this is the right place 
to ask. A preliminary note: I'm computer literate but by no means an expert 
on anything besides Minesweeper.I have been working on a bibliography of the good St. Boniface and am using 
a program called ProCite. If it ever gets done it will be fully annotated, 
but for now I wish to make my data accessible via the web. Initially I 
thought that ProCite could do this for me, but it turns out that it can 
only generate output as HTML, not make it searchable via the internet. Can 
any of you tell me how I can do this? Better yet, can an amateur like me do 
this? The database is fairly large--I believe I have some 750 titles in it 
right now.Your kind input is appreciated!Michel AaijMichel Aaij, Ph.D.
