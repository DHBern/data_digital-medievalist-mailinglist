Subject: [dm-l] the future of palaeography at King's College London

King’s College London is undertaking what they call ‘strategic  
disinvestment’ and have recently informed Professor David Ganz that  
funding for his Chair in Palaeography will cease from 31 August this  
year, when he will be out of a job. This is part of a wider context  
whereby all academic staff in the School of Arts and Humanities at  
King’s have to re-apply for their own jobs before the 1st of March.  
They think this the “most humane way” of losing 22 academic posts.

This is the only established chair in Palaeography in the UK  
(previously held by Julian Brown and Tilly de la Mare). The more  
people who write in protest the better.
