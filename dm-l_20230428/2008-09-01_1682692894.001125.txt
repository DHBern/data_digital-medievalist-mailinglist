Subject: Re: [dm-l] Searching for a search engine

In haste...

Lucene will do fuzzy matching based on Levenshtein distance (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance 
), which might work for you.  You'd have to figure out whether the  
defaults work for you or whether you'd have to figure out your own.

You might look for any work on phonetic algorithms (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_algorithm 
) for Latin.  I'm not aware of any.
