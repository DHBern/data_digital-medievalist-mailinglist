Hi Dorothy,

thank-you for all the information. I was at the ALLC/ACh conference in 
Sweden and I had ettended your talk of course, which I enjoied a lot. 

D: Thank you!

By the way, what I'm curious about it's exactly what you call "encoding 
paleographical descriptions using a simple template interface".

D: Rather than entering markup into the text by hand (think NoteTab Pro), the editor uses a template to compare the letter to be described with other (example) letters and selects descriptive elements from drop-down menus - the markup is entered automatically (and you don't need to look at the tags if you don't want to). It's a very user-friendly approach.

Dot

Looking forward your publications,
Best wishes,

Arianna Ciula

Briefly, it will enable to editor to view a manuscript image alongside a transcript, and encode paleographical descriptions using a simple template interface. It's still under development, although Kevin Kiernan, PI on the projects, has shown several demonstrations, including one at Kzoo in May.

We also have a short article coming out in the July DigiCULT Newsletter [http://www.digicult.info/pages/index.php] that gives a bit of history and briefly describes DucType and our other editing tools.
