Subject: [dm-l] Reminder: Digital Medievalist Elections

Dear all,

This is a reminder to please vote now for the DM Executive Board. This is a working executive, so the people you elect will run the journal, conference sessions, mailing-list, news server, and everything else to do with DM. For this reason, it is important that you vote to ensure that we have the best people possible.

Anybody currently subscribed to Digital Medievalist is eligible to vote. There are 4 vacancies on the board and eight candidates. Eligible voters may vote for up to four candidates. Candidate biographies are available at http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/election2010/ The ballot is available at http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/YFN6TLW

In order to check eligibility, voters will be asked to supply the email address they use for their subscription to dm-l. This information will not be used for any other purpose, and will be discarded after the election.

Many thanks,

Peter Stokes and Dan Oâ€™Donnell
