Subject: [dm-l] Junicode 0.7.1

Yet another release of Junicode, the font for medievalists.

There were significant problems with some Windows apps in version 0.7. 
These have now been fixed in version 0.7.1; all Windows users should 
update their copies. But there are other incremental improvements as 
well, so OS X and Linux users may as well update.

Be sure to delete the old version before installing the new: there have 
been some file name and font name changes, and so failure to delete the 
old copy will surely cause problems.
