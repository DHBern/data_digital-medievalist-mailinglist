Subject: Re: [dm-l] what xslt can't do..?

I've always been happy to agree with Peter(Robinson) that XSLT has some 
major limitations.  I, like Peter(Baker) think that a solution can be 
found within XSLT for this problem.  My approach would be, like 
Peter(Baker) suggests, to do multiple transforms.  Increasingly I'm 
doing this not as a set of discrete files (though the modularity of that 
is very attractive), but through using variables in XSLT2 which can then 
have further operations applied to them.  i.e. creating temporary trees 
since you can continue to work on so-called result tree fragments in 
XSLT2.  But Peter Binkley has solved the specific problem in his post.

However, as a general approach, I like to see the first step as a 
conversion of one hierarchy to another, so converting every element in 
the document to milestone like elements indicating start and end.  The 
priviledging that set of milestones that are most important to you for 
that transformation.

But the XML could have been encoded as such to begin with couldn't it? 
So perhaps the problem isn't that it can be difficult in XSLT to 
transform from one arbitrary hierarchy to another, but that the choice 
of hierarchy should be suited to the purpose.  If the aim is to display 
pages, then priviledge that hierarchy and break the other ones?

I've knocked up a quick XSLT1 stylesheet that takes any XML document as 
an input, and wraps it in a document element and creates all other 
elements (except <head> and <pb/> ;-) ) as milestone elements indicating 
their start and end.

So, passing the text.xml through it, I get:
--------------
<document>
    <div startrue"/>
            <head>The whole text and all the texts</head>
            <div startrue"/>
            <pb nñ"/>
            <head>First text</head>
            <p startrue" nñ"/>some text starts here and goes ita<hi 
startrue" rendtalic"/>lic an<pb nò"/>d then<hi endrue" 
rendtalic"/> we get a pagebreak<p endrue" nñ"/>
            <p startrue" nò"/>so the text finishes<p endrue" nò"/>
            <p startrue" nó"/> with yet another page <pb nó"/> 
and another page start <p endrue" nó"/>
            <div endrue"/>
            <div startrue"/>
            <head>Second text</head>
            <pb nô"/>
            <p startrue" nñ"/>here my new text on the next page etc 
etc<p endrue" nñ"/>
            <pb nõ"/>
            <p startrue" nò"/>here my new text on the next page etc 
etc<p endrue" nò"/>
            <div endrue"/>
    <div endrue"/>
</document>
--------------
Then one could fairly easily use an xsl:for-each-group solution to group 
elements by <pb>.  For what it is worth (and it could be done in a more 
sophisticated and efficient manner) the XSLT for milestoning a document 
that I knocked up was:
--------------
<?xml versionñ.0" encodingtf-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xslttp://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" 
versionñ.0">
    <xsl:output methodml" indento" encodingtf-8"/>
    <xsl:template match">
       <document>
          <xsl:call-template nameþlement-start"/>
          <xsl:apply-templates/>
          <xsl:call-template nameþlement-end"/>
       </document>
    </xsl:template>
    <xsl:template match" priority1">
       <xsl:call-template nameþlement-start"/>
       <xsl:apply-templates/>
       <xsl:call-template nameþlement-end"/>
    </xsl:template>
    <xsl:template matchead">
       <head>
          <xsl:apply-templates/>
       </head>
    </xsl:template>
    <xsl:template matchb">
       <pb>
_redacted_@*">
             <xsl:attribute namename()}">
                <xsl:value-of select"/>
             </xsl:attribute>
          </xsl:for-each>
       </pb>
    </xsl:template>
    <xsl:template nameþlement-start">
       <xsl:element namename()}">
          <xsl:attribute nametart">true</xsl:attribute>
_redacted_@*">
             <xsl:attribute namename()}">
                <xsl:value-of select"/>
             </xsl:attribute>
          </xsl:for-each>
       </xsl:element>
    </xsl:template>
    <xsl:template nameþlement-end">
       <xsl:element namename()}">
          <xsl:attribute nameþnd">true</xsl:attribute>
_redacted_@*">
             <xsl:attribute namename()}">
                <xsl:value-of select"/>
             </xsl:attribute>
          </xsl:for-each>
       </xsl:element>
    </xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
