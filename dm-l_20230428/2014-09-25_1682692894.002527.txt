Subject: Re: [dm-l] Image Content in Digital Projects and Metadata

Dear Franz,

Your thoughts on why there is a gap concerning the degree to which image content is catalogued, the lack of a common taxonomy/terminology and expertise are, to some extent, probably correct. However, in the visual arts, there has been considerable development on common terminology and taxonomy (the Getty Institute in NA for one has been quite active in supporting the development of controlled vocabularies -- ULAN, AAT, TGN, CONA -- as well as the work of the Visual Resources Association concerning metadata schema, VRA Core http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html ), which I think is often overlooked by institutions taking on large scale digitization projects. This is probably due to the lack of expertise or knowledge about this field and probably also due to the way digitization projects have evolved, separately, from visual collections. Increasingly, I can see a major role for libarians/cataloguers with visual studies/art history backgrounds in this area as technology begins to enable us to bring collections together between and within institutions. Thank you for suggesting the Horvolt bibliography and I see that she does reference Iconclass which is applicable to a number of different historical periods (and used by the larger European image collections, such as Marburg, as well as, at Princeton, ICA, and other sites in NA). I don't think many specialists outside the visual area are aware of this resource for cataloguing image content. However, I realize that current technology does pose additional issues on this complex topic - but, I think this is an area which needs to be examined in greater detail. Setting standards and guidelines enabling this might be the first step in exploring more collaboration. Thank you for thinking about this...Harriet.

Dear Harriet,

The degree to which images are described in TEI and the frequency varies of course as much as there are projects creating manuscript descriptions. A higher standardization and deeper structuring of the content of <decoDesc>s and <decoNote>s is desirable - but hard to achieve for the lack of a common terminology or taxonomy and not least for the lack of expertise of cataloguers.

BTW, there is a selected bibliography on decoration of manuscripts by Hanna Vorholt available on the DiXiT webpage (course material of MMSDA
2014):

Best, Franz
