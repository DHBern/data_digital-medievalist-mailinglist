Subject: Re: [dm-l] Plain text access to medieval manuscripts: 147 volumes

Dear Dominique,

Thanks for getting back to me!

I look forward to reading the papers relating to the Handwritten 
Text Recognition you used. Can you please point me to them (or let 
me know where they'll be published when they're ready, if they 
aren't yet available)? OCR is a field I've been involved in for a 
while, though I'm only just starting to learn about handwriting 
recognition. Does the A2iA approach use neural networks, and 
leverage some open source software within it, I wonder? I look 
forward to finding out from the journal articles!

Excellent news that you'll be releasing the plain text in due 
course, under an appropriately non-restrictive license. Out of 
curiousity, how is the output from the text recognition engine being 
stored and used at the moment? Is it in some XML format listing 
locations and alternatives for words, or is it in a database, or 
something else? For bonus credits you could always release that too; 
though probably it'd be a bit niche for anyone else to reuse, who 
knows, and it could provide a good exemplar for good practise for 
others to follow or investigate when designing their own project.

Great project, I've enjoyed reading about it, and keep up the good 
work.

Nick
