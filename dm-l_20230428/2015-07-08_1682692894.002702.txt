programs developed by the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the 
University of Leipzig in collaboration with the Harvardâ€™s Center for 
Hellenic Studies. Sunoikisis DC aims at reaching a global audience and 
offers collaborative courses that foster interdisciplinary paradigms of 
learning and allow students of both the humanities and computer science 
to work together by contributing to digital classics projects in a 
collaborative environment. The goal of this talk is to present the 
activities of the consortium and its results.
