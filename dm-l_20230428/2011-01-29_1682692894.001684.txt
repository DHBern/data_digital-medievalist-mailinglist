Subject: Re: [dm-l] Teaching the TEI: your practice?

I think it's certainly true that if you're used to a procedural language like Perl, a functional(ish) language like XSLT will seem bizarre.  But I'm not sure XSLT is any stranger than any other programming language to someone without programming experience.

Learning a (another) procedural language might be easier for someone who already learned a procedural language, but I find the way XSLT work so quite straight forward that once you understood how XML works it might be easy to understand XSLT too?! If you learned object oriented programming like Java, XML-processing with XSLT, XPath etc seems to be very similar?
