Subject: Re: [dm-l] Day of Digital Humanities

I'd like to add two things about this as a participant last year:

1) It is a lot of fun.
2) It always occurs on the day that nothing you do is of any relevance: 
i.e. a sick day, an examination day in your "pre-digital era research 
techniques" class, a day you spend on the beach, etc.

Let me encourage tons of medievalists to participate so we distort things ;)
