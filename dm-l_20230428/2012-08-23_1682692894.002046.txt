Subject: [dm-l] Geospatial/Geodetic mapping of MSS

Thanks to all who have replied (off list, I think) to my query about linguistic mapping of Middle English MSS.

Dan O'Donnell asked for a sample of the markup. The DIMEV is an xml-based project. I haven't added mapping information as yet, but here is a straightforward example of the MS file with the <lang> entry:

 <item xml:id="PhilUPEng8">
        <loc>Philadelphia</loc>
        <repos>University of Pennsylvania</repos>
        <desc>MS Codex 218 [formerly Eng. 8; <i>olim</i> Stonor Park]</desc>
        <lang><biblio key="LALME">LALME</biblio> LP 559 (<place country="England" county="Isle of Ely">Ely</place>: Hand A, ff. 1-146v); LP 551 (<place country="England" county="Lincolnshire">Lincs</place>:
            Hand B, ff. 147-195v)</lang>
    </item>

The LALME and LAEME keys are linked to full entries in the bibliography. I'm waiting for my coder to fit some time in for the style-sheet updates for this information.

Since I haven't, as yet, constructed a tagging structure for the mapping coordinates, I'm happy to have suggestions. Dan mentioned KML and Google maps, and that might be an easy way to proceed.
