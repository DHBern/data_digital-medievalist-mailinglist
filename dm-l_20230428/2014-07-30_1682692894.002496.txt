Subject: [dm-l] Registration Opens for DigiPal Symposium: Monday 1st September

Dear all,

It is with great delight that the DigiPal team at the Department of Digital Humanities (King's College London) 
announce the programme for the fourth DigiPal Symposium. For those who have attended in previous years, 
it will be the usual mix of medieval manuscripts, computer-assisted techniques, camaraderie and palaeography. 
And if you haven't attended before, then now's an excellent time to start. 

Speakers include Julia Crick, Peter Stokes, Marc Smith, Dot Porter, Ben Pohl, Matilda Watson and Debora Matos.

Registration is required, but it's free. And with lunch and wine thrown in, how could you go wrong? Aside from missing it ;-)
