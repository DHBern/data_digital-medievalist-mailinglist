Search for Inaugural Curator of the Schoenberg Institute of Manuscript Studies

In April 2011, The University of Pennsylvania Libraries was the recipient of an extraordinary gift – The Lawrence J Schoenberg Collection of Manuscripts.   Mr. Schoenberg’s collection is widely known in manuscript circles and he has generously provided physical and  digital access to scholars around the world for over a decade.    The Schoenberg Collection documents through its many fine exemplars the transformation of knowledge through the lens of pre-early modern,  hand-copied books in a variety of languages and scripts which document the evolution of the study of  science, medicine and mathematics, among other subjects.  Please visit http://sceti.library.upenn.edu/ljscollection/index.cfm to learn more about the Schoenberg initiatives at UPenn. 

In recognition of the Schoenberg gift,  the University of Pennsylvania Libraries is pleased to announce the  creation of  the Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies (SIMS). The new institute will form one of  the cornerstones of the new Special Collection Center now being constructed. The two year renovation project  will transform the former Rare Book and Manuscript Library into a 21st Century scholarly hub for the study of material and digital texts.   

To provide leadership for the Schoenberg Institute, the UPenn Libraries is seeking an experienced   and qualified manuscript studies scholar to serve as the Institute’s inaugural curator.  For a complete job description and access to the online application,  please  follow the link to the University of Pennsylvania’s job site:  http://www.library.upenn.edu/hr/professional/curator.html

Salary is competitive and commensurate with experience from the mid 60s and up.  Includes a generous benefits package – additional information available at http://www.hr.upenn.edu/jobs/benefits.asp .
