Dear Colleagues,

*Manuscripts Online 1000 to 1500: Exploring Early Written Culture in the Digital Age*

Registration is now open for 'Manuscripts Online 1000 to 1500: Exploring Early Written Culture in the Digital Age', a one day conference to be on 11 January 2013 at the University of Leicester to celebrate the conclusion of the JISC funded project Manuscripts Online < http://manuscriptsonline.wordpress.com/about/>.

We have two internationally acclaimed plenaries: Andrew Prescott (King's College, London) and William Noel (University of Pennsylvania). Papers will explore the significance of our approach to data mining and federated searching to manuscript studies and early written culture. Speakers will also talk about the value and benefit of the project for teaching and researching early written cultures, and discuss how the resource, which is created by the project, is an opportunity to explore different techniques and approaches across disciplines. We are aiming to build in plenty of space for participation/discussion.

Information about the venue and on how to register are available on the Conference website <https://swww2.le.ac.uk/departments/english/news/conferences/manuscriptsonline>. Registration, lunch and refreshments are free, but please register using the online form by 3 January 2013. Places are limited, book early to avoid disappointment.

We look forward to welcoming you in  Leicester, please, circulate this announcement with colleagues and students.

Best wishes, 

Orietta
