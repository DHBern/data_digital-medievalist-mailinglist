Subject: [dm-l] Server problems

Of course we no sooner start a list than everything goes kaplooey. The 
University of Lethbridge has been having listserv administration 
problems since about 10am Mountain time. This may or may not prevent 
messages from getting through and is preventing me from accepting new 
subscriptions. Hopefully it will be over soon.
