Subject: Re: [dm-l] Teaching the TEI: your practice?

Dear Godfried,

although this seems to be perfectly reasonable,

I wonder how to prove this? Learning a (another) procedural language 
might be easier for someone who already learned a procedural language, 
but I find the way XSLT work so quite straight forward that once you 
understood how XML works it might be easy to understand XSLT too?! If 
you learned object oriented programming like Java, XML-processing with 
XSLT, XPath etc seems to be very similar?

But I admit it might be only me estimating this?

Best, Torsten
