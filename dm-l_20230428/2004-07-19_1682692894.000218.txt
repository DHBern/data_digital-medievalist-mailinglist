Subject: Re: [dm-l] Anastasia goes open sourceDear everyoneA few weeks ago I announced that Anastasia, our own xml publishing system,
was going open source.  We have now put the distibutable binaries for OS X
and Windows on source forge; the source is currently uploading and should be
available in a few hours.
You can read about it now at:
http://anastasia.sourceforge.net
And get it from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/anastasiaAll the best
