Subject: [dm-l] Digitisation Survey

Hello all,

The Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org) is exploring the  
feasibility of a benefit of membership in the form of a negotiated  
vendor discount for producing machine-readable, xml-encoded text in  
small- to medium-scale digitization projects. 

Please take a few minutes to complete the survey at the link below in
order to provide us with information that would help us negotiate with
vendors on the basis of an accurate assessment of the nature and extent
of demand for such a benefit.

Sincerely,

Daniel Paul O'Donnell, PhD
Chair, Text Encoding Initiative http://www.tei-c.org/
