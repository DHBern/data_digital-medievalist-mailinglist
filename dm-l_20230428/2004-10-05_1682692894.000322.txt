Subject: [dm-l] Character reference conversions: help?

Hello all,
	I need some advice on converting Unicode character references. 
Currently, am encoding character references in what I believe is UCS-4 
format (Universal Character Set). This means they look like this in my 
source files:

&#x1090;

I want to import xhtml documents into Open Office, which seems to need 
UTF-8 encoding (I don't know what UTF stands for). Does anybody know of 
a filter that might do the conversions for me? Or have advice on using 
open office (Windows version) with UCS-4 encoding?
