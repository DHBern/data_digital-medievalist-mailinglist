Is there a demo version for experimenting?

In my opinion mailing lists are better than any forum on the condition
that you use a decent software to read mail. If you read mail using
some cumbersome Web interface then of course the situation is
different. On the other hand almost all mailing lists have also some
Web interfaces, so the comparison is not straightforward.
