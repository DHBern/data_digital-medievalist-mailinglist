Subject: Re: [dm-l] Mailing List, Wiki, Blog or what?

I have some experience in building communities, and I'd say that you 
should always see the mailing list as core. This is because it pushes 
information out, but also because it serves as a locus of identity: 
while people complain about list traffic if it gets too high, they 
nevertheless do tend to subscribe. Lists like dm-l and globaloutlookdh-l 
even have people who subscribe and then set themselves to no mail!

In a modern community, I think you want to supplement the list with some 
other things and try, as much as possible, to see the different channels 
as different portals into roughly the same information set:

* You need a twitter feed, since many people follow things that way;
* You should have a blog for larger items; personally, I'd try to 
encourage people to contribute guest postings to it, but I've found that 
hard. I've wondered about somehow using syndication capabilities as a 
way of capturing content.
* You want a news service for community announcements--that does tend to 
get used if you promote it.
* I'm less convinced that wikis work that well for most communities.

Ideally, all should be integrated: so blog posts should be announced on 
twitter and the mailing list; announcements should go to the mailing 
list and twitter and show up on the blog (maybe in a sidebar); I wonder 
if it wouldn't make sense to somehow capture the list traffic on the 
blog as well: perhaps by adding a page that includes the archive or 
posting a digest each day as a posting. But I've not worked out any good 
ideas on how to do that.
