Hi all,
we've just released EVT 0.1.62 with experimental support for the 
embedded transcription method. A sample edition collecting miscellaneous 
examples (including those presented in the Guidelines) is available here:

http://vbd.humnet.unipi.it/evt-et/

and a blog post describing EVT changes is here:

http://visualizationtechnology.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/tei-embedded-transcription-support-in-evt/

while the EVT code with all of above is as usual available on Sourceforge:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/evt-project/

We'd appreciate feedback and suggestions on how to improve it (and of 
course other EVT features), as written in the blog post we weren't sure 
of how to interpret some of the possible use cases. Seeing TEI XML from 
the point of view of a tool developer, for once, was an eye opening 
experience!

Last, but definitely not least, let me thank the EADH "small grants" 
program which made this expansion of EVT's features possible.

Best,

R
