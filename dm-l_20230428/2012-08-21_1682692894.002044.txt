Subject: [dm-l] Geospatial mapping of Middle English MSS

I don't even know if I'm deploying the correct terminology, but here goes.

I have been adding linguistic information to the Digital Index of Middle English Verse (www.dimev.net) from the Linguistic Atlases of Late and Early Medieval English.  Their references are to a grid, which doesn't seem to be useful in the long term (if I'm wrong about this, please say so).

What we would like to do, or collaborate with somebody to do, is add geospatial coordinates for the anchor and localized texts with the aim of linking them to a mapping program (Google or something else).

Is anyone already doing this in the digital-medieval world, or does this wheel need inventing by someone.

Naively,

Dan
