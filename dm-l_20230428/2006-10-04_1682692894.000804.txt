Dear Dan,
Thierry Daubos has been working on a project here to do 3D scans, mostly of
inscribed stones, but he'd be able to help you out. You can take a look at
his work at:
http://www.foundationsirishculture.ie
by clicking on the Profilometry of Medieval Monuments tab on the right.

Hope this helps!
All the best,
Mark
