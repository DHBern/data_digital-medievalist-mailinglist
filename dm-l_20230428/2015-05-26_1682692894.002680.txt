    (Document) Changes: Modeling, Detection, Storage and Visualization

                http://diff.cs.unibo.it/dchanges2015/

Part of 15th ACM SIGWEB International Symposium on Document Engineering

             Lausanne, Switzerland, September 8th, 2015

CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

DChanges 2015 is the third edition of the International Workshop on 
(Document) Changes: Modeling, Detection, Storage and Visualization in 
conjunction with the 15th ACM SIGWEB International Symposium on Document 
Engineering. This year, the workshop will be held in Lausanne 
(Switzerland) in September 2015.

The focus of the workshop is the study of changes in all its aspects and 
applications: algorithms to detect changes, models to describe 
differences, techniques to track changes, versioning of human-readable 
as well as computer-oriented files, tools to detect meaningful changes 
among a myriad of modifications.

We want to look at these topics from different perspectives, and take on 
different approaches. The workshop brings together researchers and 
practitioners from industry and academia. It is a unique occasion to 
discuss these issues in an informal setting and to foster collaboration.

The previous editions emphasised a strong need for novel algorithms and 
interfaces to better understand and exploit detected changes. Several 
issues were pointed out as still unsolved: interfaces do not scale when 
dealing with many changes, changes at different levels of abstraction 
are often not sufficiently taken into account, detection and 
visualization are often inter-mixed, logs are often detailed but 
underexploited, and versioning techniques are not very well suited for 
non-technical people.

Besides contributions on these topics, we also seek contributions on, 
but not necessarily limited to:

	* Diffing and change tracking algorithms
		* Change modeling and representation
		* High-level differences
		* Detecting changes on complex data structures
		* Detecting changes on trees, graphs, diagrams and any kind of document
		* Novel approaches to tree-based diff
		* Edit-distance measures
		* Quality of deltas and patches
		* Editing patterns
		* Semantic diff
	* Merging
		* Management of update conflicts
		* N-way merge algorithms
		* Propagation of changes
		* Versioning systems
	* Versioning
	* Collaborative editing
		* Real-time collaborative editing
		* Distributed collaboration
	* Use in digital humanities
		* Collation
		* Text genetics
		* Stemmatology
		* Plagiarism detection
	* Applications of diff techniques from and to other domains
		* Software engineering, law, medicine etc.
	* Document and schema refactoring

Contributions from related areas are also well accepted.

Program
--------

The workshop will run a full day, divided in two parts to emphasize both 
theoretical/algorithmic aspects and practical applications. Ample space 
will be given to peer discussions and brainstorming about the results of 
the presentations and the ideas brought forth by participants.

A detailed schedule will be announced in August.

Proceedings
-----------

We plan to publish our proceedings via ACM ICPS, as we did last year. 
Further details on the publication venue for the proceedings will be 
available soon.

Important Dates
---------------

* Abstracts are due: June 28th, 2015
* Papers and notes are due: July 3rd, 2015
* Acceptance notice: July 31st, 2015
* Camera ready: August 24th, 2015

Paper submission
----------------

Two types of submissions are possible:

* Application/demo notes: 2-4 pages long, showcasing systems or tools
* Research papers: 4-8 pages long, describing original and unpublished 
research

All papers must conform to the ACM SIG Proceedings format: 
<https://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html/>.

Papers must be submitted to the EasyChair site 
<https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dchanges2015>. All submissions 
will undergo a rigorous single blind review process.
