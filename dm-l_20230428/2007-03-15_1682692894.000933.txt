Subject: [dm-l] Temporary change in list behaviour

Hi all,

For the duration of the balloting, I have changed the default behaviour
of the list: if you wish to reply to a message on dm-l, you will need to
_redacted_(a)uleth.ca manually. Otherwise, your email will go only to the
poster of the message to which you are replying.

I am changing it this way to avoid accidental postings of ballots. After
the election is over, the list behaviour will return to normal.
