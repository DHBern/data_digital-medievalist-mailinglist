Subject: Re: [dm-l] Equipment for creating digital facsimiles

For texts (books) then I would say use a scanner.  I know someone who did
this with a anthology of Old English by Conybeare.  The facs. was very
good.  If you use a scanner you can produce pages as fast as the scanner
can scan them.  Its up to you really!  Also, I would suggest using
Photoshop for your imaging program, because that's the best available.
