CALL FOR PROPOSALS

doing digital: using digital resources in the arts and humanities

DRHA07 : Dartington College of Art : 9 - 12  September 2007

Bringing together creators, practitioners, users, distributors,
and custodians of Digital Resources in the Arts and Humanities

Over the last decade the annual Digital Resources for the Humanities and  Arts
(DRHA) conferences have constructed an unusual kind of meeting place: a  space
in which researchers, curators, and distributors of digital resources could
meet and share perspectives on their complementary agendas. Last year, that
forum was expanded to include participants from the creative and performing
arts, giving the event a new flavour and a new direction. This year, the
conference aims to explore further major issues at the interface between
traditional humanities scholarship and the 
creative arts, by focussing on their
differing or complementary approaches to the deployment of digital
technologies. Can the Arts and the Humanities 
share expertise? Are they divided
by a common tongue? To what extent are they developing common technical
solutions to different problem areas? As in 
previous years, the conference will
articulate these questions by showcasing the very best in current practice
across the widest spectrum of digital applications in the arts and  humanities
and by fostering informed but accessible debate amongst professionals.

The Programme Committee for DRHA07 is now soliciting imaginative and
provocative contributions for the conference addressing such topics as:

       * the benefits and the challenges of  using 
digital resources in creative
work, in teaching and learning, and in scholarship;
       * the challenges and opportunities 
associated with scale and sustainability
in the digital arena;
       * new insights and new forms of expression 
arising from the integration of
digital resources in the arts, humanities, and sciences;
       * social and political issues surrounding 
digital resource provision in the
context of global ICT developments;
       * the implications of "born-digital" 
resources for curators, consumers, and
performers;
       * training methods and best practice for digital arts and humanities
practitioners.

Other themes include: interactivity and performance; digital media in time  and
space; integration and deployment of existing digital resources in new
contexts; policies and strategies for digital deployment, both commercial  and
non-commercial; cataloguing and metadata aspects 
of resource discovery; digital
repositories; Web 2.0 and other new technologies; encoding standards;
intellectual property rights; funding, cost-recovery, and charging  mechanisms;
digitization techniques and problems.

Format: The conference will take up three intensive days, comprising
presentation of academic papers and technical reports, performance and
installation events,  software and product 
demonstrations, debates and training
events.  The atmosphere will be informal, the discussion energetic. Leading
practitioners and representatives of key funding 
agencies, such as the the Arts
Council, the AHRC, the JISC, and the AHDS  will 
be amongst the participants. We
hope that from this occasion a new consensus will emerge based on real life
experience of the application of digital techniques and resources in the
Humanities and Arts.

Timetable: Proposals are now invited for academic 
papers, themed panel sessions
and reports of work in progress.Your proposal should be no smaller than 500
words and no longer than 2000; closing date for 
proposals is  May 2nd 2007. All
proposals will be reviewed by an independent panel of reviewers, and
notifications of acceptance will be sent out by 13th June 2007. All accepted
proposals will be included in the Conference preprint volume, and will also  be
considered for a post-conference publication.

Cost: The all-in conference rate covering all 
meals and accomodation as well as
conference registration and proceedings will not 
exceed £400. Reduced rates for
early registration, and partial rates for one-day 
or non-residential attendance
will be announced shortly on the conference website.
