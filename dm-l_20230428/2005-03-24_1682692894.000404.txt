Subject: Re: [dm-l] Kzoo 2006 - looking ahead

Thanks for raising this Dot. I was planning to e-mail about it over the 
weekend.

DM has booked space for a business meeting on Friday May 6th at Noon in 
Fetzer 1060 in part for this very purpose. Our feeling was that it might 
be useful for various projects to meet face to face to plan subsequent 
events.

Of course much of this could be accomplished by e-mail in advance.
