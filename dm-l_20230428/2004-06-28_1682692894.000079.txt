Probably.  Should we be building sites to the browsers/users or 
just build them to the standards and wait for browers/users to 
catch up?  Obviously while I'd like to do the latter, in practice 
I do the former.  I do try to avoid the browser-specific hacks 
that were mentioned earlier however (for the already mentioned 
fear of their need for migration).  This is common in CSS to 
produce hacks that display the same in MSIE and other browsers.  
Better, in my opinion, to only use CSS that most modern 
browsers understand.
