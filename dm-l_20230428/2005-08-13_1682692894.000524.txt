Subject: Re: [dm-l] TEI and concurrent hierarchies

Dear Marjorie

As James has already pointed out, there are a number of varyingly 
satisfactory ways of dealing with the inescapable fact that a textual 
artefact can be regarded as having more than one hierarchic structure. 
The only issue really is deciding on which one to privilege when 
representing it in XML.

Your use of the phrase "rhetorical elements" (plus my recollections of a 
pleasant visit to Lyon some years ago!) suggests to me that you are 
trying to mark up the rhetorical structure of an existing text.  This 
seems a somewhat different kind of structure from the usual structure of 
prose paragraphs and divisions, in that it can be determined only by 
some understanding of the text and also of other texts like it, and also 
in that it rarely if ever has any kind of associated conventional 
rendering.

The mechanism suggested by the TEI for this purpose is described, rather 
obscurely, in the chapter on "Simple Analytic Mechanisms", in particular 
in section 15.3 on  "Spans and Interpretations", where there is an 
example showing how the narrative structure of an extract from the 
Poetic Edda might be encoded. Essentially  it recommends what is now 
fashionably know as "standoff" annotation,  in which a special kind of 
pointer element (a "span") is used to indicate a stretch of text and to 
associate a particular interpretive label with it. Such spans can be 
organized hierarchically in the same way as other XML elements. The 
stretches of texts indicated will often be existing "structural" XML 
elements such as paragraphs or sections, but do not need to: an empty 
<anchor> (or milestone)  element can be inserted at any necessary point 
to act as a target for a link of this kind.

I would like to revise this particular section of the Guidelines for P5 
in order to make it a bit more accessible: it would be great to include 
an example from Voragine!

best wishes
