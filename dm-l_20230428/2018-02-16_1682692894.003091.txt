Subject: [dm-l] CFP Digital Classicist London, summer 2018 seminar

The Digital Classicist invites proposals for the summer 2018 seminar series, which will run on Friday afternoons in June and July in the Institute of Classical Studies, Senate House, London.

We would like to see papers that address the tension between standardisation and customisation in digital and other innovative and collaborative classics research. The seminar encompasses all areas of classics, including ancient history, archaeology and reception (including cultures beyond the Mediterranean). Papers from researchers of all levels, including students and professional practitioners, are welcome.

There is a budget to assist with travel to London (usually from within the UK, but we have occasionally been able to assist international presenters to attend). To submit a paper, please email an abstract of up to 300 words as an a_redacted_(a)sas.ac.uk by Monday, March 19th, 2018.
