Subject: [dm-l] Seminar on Digital History next weekMay I draw members attention to a new seminar at the Institute for Historical=
 Research in London, starting next week. Information can be found at: http://=
www.history.ac.uk/events/seminars/321
Though it will not always concern medieval history next week it does, and for=
 those not in London but interested the seminar is being streamed live.
