Subject: [dm-l] DH2019 workshops - Call for participation workshop

Dear list,

** Usual apologies for cross-posting apply **

We are pleased to invite submissions for lightning talk presentations (5 minutes) at the half-day workshop "Accelerating DH Education" taking place *Monday 8th July from 9am to 1pm* at DH2019 in Utrecht.

The workshop offers an exceptional platform for communication between DH practitioners, specialists in educational sciences and digital innovation strategists. Among its organisers are people connected to several Dutch universities and research institutions alongside nationwide initiatives SURF (the collaborative ICT organisation for Dutch education and research) and the VSNU (the Dutch Association of Universities) that together in 2018 initiated the national "Acceleration plan educational innovation with ICT". This combination of DH experts and educational specialists presents a unique opportunity to consider a shared strategic agenda for innovation in DH education. 

The workshop is organised primarily around two strands of discussion: 
(1) *Open Education*. Open Education can be defined in multiple ways, we will zoom in on the aspects that could be of relevance to Digital Humanities education, and to map and imagine its implications for accessible, inclusive and sustainable approaches to its delivery. 

(2) *Shared educational agendas and initiatives*. How can we move towards more cooperative and evidence-based approaches to teaching and training in DH across the community? What are the key desiderata for educational innovation in DH? This strand will feature both national agendas and international initiatives including the #dariahTeach platform.

We welcome 200-300 word proposals from anyone involved or interested in the creation and usage of educational resources in DH.

Submissions can be sent via the online submission form<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehm6IWZ3LoXbc6ZLhlAGxq-0C84sSahOXIod5khexuF4dWxg/viewform?usp=sf_link>. The deadline for submission is *Monday 6th May* at midnight (CET). Applicants will be notified of acceptance by the end of May.

Please note that the Early Bird Registration for the ADHO conference<https://dh2019.adho.org/registration/> is valid until the 29th of March.

Looking forward to seeing you in Utrecht this year!

Best,
