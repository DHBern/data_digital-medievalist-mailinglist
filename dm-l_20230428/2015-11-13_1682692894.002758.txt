Subject: [dm-l] British Patristics Conference 2016

[With apologies if you receive this message more than once]

We are delighted to announce that the call for papers and, indeed, booking for very early birds, is now open for the Sixth British Patristics conference.

The conference will be held at the University of Birmingham from Monday 5th to Wednesday 7th September 2016.
Proposals are invited for papers on any aspect of patristic study. We are particularly keen to receive contributions on the reception of Pauline literature or commentaries more generally. As in previous years, we expect to organise two or three thematic sessions running in parallel. Proposals should be submitted with an abstract of up to 250 words through the conference website by 30th April 2016.

The website, with all details and forms, is available at:

We hope to welcome you to Birmingham next year!

Best wishes,
Hugh Houghton (on behalf of the organisers)
