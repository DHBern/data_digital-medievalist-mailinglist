This is most impressive! It works fine on Firefox 3.5.6 (MacOs X
10.6). In "1345 : prologue d'un compte" scrolling back and forth from
the image to the transcription box is a little bit difficult but
that's no big deal.

> Dear list,
> I'm pleased to announce that Castellanie.net, a website publishing images and soon transcriptions of the XIIIth century account rolls of the House of Savoy, now proposes self-corrective online paleography exercices to help students and beginners to learn how to read those accounts. Four exercices are available now, with more to come. They can be accessed from the main website (www.castellanie.net) or directly at this URL:
> http://paleographie.castellanie.net
>
> What may also be of interest to some of you is that those exercices are generated directly from Image Markup Tool, thanks to a customized XSL, CSS and Javascript, making it very easy to create new exercices, including for scholars with zero web design skills.
> I plan to make the XSL / CSS / Javascript available online very soon, after just a little bit of polishing.
> Besides, as we plan to extend the collection of exercices, any feedback about the interface, functionalities, etc. will be most welcome :)
>
> Best regards, an Happy New Year!
> Marjorie
