Subject: Re: [dm-l] Digital Manuscript Projects

Dear Klaus and list,

Thank you for the updated URLs, and I apologise for the e-mails about old projects which have just been posted to the list. We are in the process of reconfiguring the DM infrastructure, and a slip-up during this has meant that some pages from the old DM wiki were sent to the list by mistake. We believe that the problem is now fixed, and we will send out more information about the new infrastructure shortly.

Best wishes,

Peter Stokes (Director, DM)
