Subject: [dm-l] RCH Fellowship for Scholars Affected by Katrina

(I don't know how many folks on the list live in the area affected by Katrina, 
but please pass this message along to anyone who may qualify)

We at the Collaboratory for Research in Computing for Humanities (RCH) 
at the University of Kentucky are so impressed by the recent 
announcement that The Maryland Institute for Technology in the 
Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park 
(http://www.mith.umd.edu/) is offering a fellowship for scholars 
affected by Hurricane Katrina that we have petitioned the College of 
Arts and Sciences at UK to support a similar position at RCH. Please 
distribute this announcement to other lists and post as you see fit. A 
web version of the announcement is posted at 
http://www.rch.uky.edu/fellowship.html.

Thank you,
Dot Porter, Program Coordinator, RCH

NOTE:  The RCH website may be unavailable Friday, September 9, until the 
late afternoon.

*Announcement: Residential fellowship available for scholar displaced by 
Hurricane Katrina*

With the support of the College of Arts & Sciences and the University of 
Kentucky Libraries, the newly reorganized Collaboratory for Research in 
Computing for Humanities (RCH) at the University of Kentucky, 
Lexington,  is pleased to be able to offer an immediate residential 
fellowship available to any one faculty member or ABD doctoral candidate 
at an institution closed by Hurricane Katrina.

As described in our new mission statement, RCH brings together faculty 
and students from Engineering and the Humanities for research projects 
with benefits for all involved. We provide infrastructure, technical 
assistance, and grant writing assistance to individuals and groups who 
propose projects under its auspices. We also encourage and support 
interdisciplinary projects among individuals and groups from UK and 
around the world. 

We invite proposals from individual scholars who are currently working 
on a humanities computing project and require facilities to continue 
work OR who are in the process of starting a new project and require 
facilities and other assistance in getting the project off the ground. 
Projects through RCH have traditionally focused on image-based editing 
of medieval and, more recently, classical materials, however we are 
currently in the exciting process of branching out and investigating new 
topics. Any project focused on the electronic editing of or access to 
humanistic materials (manuscripts, rare books, artworks) would be 
acceptable.

For more details on RCH, please visit our website at 
http://www.rch.uky.edu/. 

The fellowship includes:

   * Private workspace, including both PC and Macintosh workstations.
   * Access to our own hardware and software, and that of the
     Preservation and Digital Programs Division
     <http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/Special/> of the University of
     Kentucky Libraries (a list of hardware available at
     http://www.rch.uky.edu/index-prop.html#Fac)
   * An opportunity to speak through the "Wednesday Seminar" series at
     the Center for Computational Sciences <http://www.ccs.uky.edu/>.
   * Access to the RCH and Stoa.org <http://www.stoa.org> development
     and production servers. This includes online publication space, as
     well as archival storage space.
   * Consulting on issues of digital scholarship.

Although we will probably not be able to offer a stipend, we are able to 
provide some funding for relocation and assistance with a search for 
housing.

To apply, please send a letter of inquiry describing your project, a CV, 
and contact information for three references. Please send application 
materials by email to Dot Porter, the RCH Program Coordinator, at
