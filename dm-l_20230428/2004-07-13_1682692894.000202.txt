Subject: Re: [dm-l] Junius 11 CD

It is truly fabulous, a great piece of work.  Samuel Fanous from the Bodleian just gave me the grand tour and I have to say I am impressed.  Beautiful images of every page, some terrific features (such as going from an edited text directly to the spot in the mss where the text is, even if in the mss it begins in the middle of the line--the markers go to the first word of the edited line and bracket it for you), bibliography, search capability, etc.  The magnification of the images works fairly well I think, and on a powerful PC rather than a laptop would be able to have several windows open at once.  The only drawback is that they chose to use the Kennedy translations of the poems, but then most of us aren't interested in the translations.  Reasonable price too...regularly Â£50 (49.99).  I'm buying this one when I get home.

BTW Martin, I dropped your name to Samuel (I know, I'm a name dropper) and he'd like to meet you and talk to you.
