While I know you're listening Dot, can you tell us more about EPT?
I enjoyed your paper in Kzoo about it, and have been meaning to try it out 
and/or investigate it further.  Is there a downloadable demo or summat?

I'm not so worried about the potential problems over overlap, but its use as a 
tool for assisting less-technical resource creators to develop more 
sophisticated electronic editions.

I've noticed there are a number of presentations mentioning it at ACH/ALLC this 
year, and I'll be attending most of them.
