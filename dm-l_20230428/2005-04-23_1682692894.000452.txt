Subject:Dear everyone
In the course of the discussion on XSLT, I referred to the forthcoming
Parliament Rolls of Medieval England -- indeed, a casual reference to this
triggered Peter Baker's response, which fired the whole discussion. 
Anyway, this is now available at www.sd-editions.com, and there is a
preview version of it at
http://www.sd-editions.com/AnaAdditional/PROMEeg/Images/home.html.  Among
other things, you can view each parliament either by page (of the 1783
printed editon) or by membrane, or by whole text: you can see this in the
sample from the May 1413 parliament of Henry V given in the web preview.
best wishes
Peter Robinson
