Dear All,

It is my greatest pleasure to announce that the web interface that manages the submissions (i.e. conftool) is finally up and running: you can upload your abstracts of papers, posters and workshops here:

http://www.tei-c.org/conftool/

If you have already an existing conftool account from previous TEI conferences you will be able to use the same, otherwise, please register in order to upload your submission.

Just a kind reminder: the deadline for submission is the *31st of May*.

Thank you very much for your patience and apologies if this delay has caused you any trouble.

All best wishes

For the International Programme Committee
Elena Pierazzo
