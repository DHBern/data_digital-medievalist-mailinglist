Subject: [dm-l] The sum of medieval knowledge

I have submitted a presentation to the London Wikimania conference 
taking place 6-10 August 2014

https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/The_sum_of_medieval_knowledge 
.

Anyone interested can sign their name up. The presentation is about 
making source documents (manuscripts, editions) more freely available on 
the web.
