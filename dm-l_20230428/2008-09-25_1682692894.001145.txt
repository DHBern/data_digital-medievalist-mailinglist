Subject: [dm-l] facebook group

For those who are interested in such things, Digital Medievalist has
created a facebook group at
http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gidI320313760 ... the main
intention of which is, of course, to publicise the website, journal,
this mailing list, etc.

Just thought I'd mention it,
