Subject: [dm-l] Filemaker Pro/MySQL/ODBC issue

HI,

I am currently migrating projects to a new server and have encountered difficulties with the Thomas L. Gravell Watermarks Archive database. As is summarized below, we have moved everything, confirmed that we can update a MySQL database on the new server using FMP and the ODBC driver, but the Gravell database itself is not communicating, despite updating scripts, etc. Has anyone on the list had recent experience with these issues? One problem is that it has been awhile since we have had to deal with a migration and there are some rusty chops! Thanks in advance for any insights. Here's the summary from my tech person:

- Moved the MySQL database to the new server. Verified that the database user has all privileges to manage the database.

- Verified that Port 3306 is open so the database can be managed remotely. 

- Installed the Actual Technologies ODBC Driver, created a new DSN for the MySQL database, and verified that we can connect to the MySQL database using ODBC.

- Updated the FileMaker Pro scripts to use the new DSN we created.

I can confirm that the MySQL database can be modified in FileMaker Pro via ODBC (I created a new FileMaker Pro database to test this), but something in the scripts in the existing FileMaker Pro database is preventing the ODBC connection from working.
