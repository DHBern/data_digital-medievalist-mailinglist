Colleagues,I should like to draw your attention to the TEI Members Meeting site at
Kings?s College London http://www.cch.kcl.ac.uk/tei2008/The outline of the meeting programme, from 6-8 November, is now
available. There are also recommendations for hotels and advice about
transport. Most importantly, registration is now open. Early
registration is advised as places are limited.Please visit the site and register for the conference. We look forward
to seeing you in November.With all best wishes
