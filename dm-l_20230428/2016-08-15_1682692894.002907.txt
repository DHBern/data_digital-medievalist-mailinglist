Subject: [dm-l] A very short survey on

Dear list members, 
I'm trying to get some data on the actual usage of the three possible TEI methods for the encoding of textual variance. 

If you are encoding or if you have encoded at least one critical edition using the Critical Apparatus module of the TEI, I would be most grateful if you could participate in this very short online survey (less than 3 minutes):

Best regards and apologies for cross-posting,
