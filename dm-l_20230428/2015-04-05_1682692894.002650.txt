Subject: [dm-l] DH-History or DH-English open-ended lectureship positions

Dear colleagues, 
I would like to bring to your attention those two lectureship position opening at the University of Bristol: 
http://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details.html?nPostingID=3073&nPostingTargetID=11079&option=30&sort=ASC&respnr=1&ID=Q50FK026203F3VBQBV7V77V83&LOV3=8490%2C8489&Resultsperpage=10&lg=UK&mask=uobext
They would be particularly interesting for medievalists, since they are about DH applied to History of English! 
Best regards, 
Marjorie
