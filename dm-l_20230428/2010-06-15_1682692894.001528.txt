Subject: RE: [dm-l] Multiple streams / stages of footnotes: what solutions?

Dear Marjorie,

I fully recognise the problem but unless you want do the typesetting yourself, then there is no real need to use any of these packages. My personal experience teaches me that professional typesetters can perfectly set as many layers of footnotes as you need and many of them will take XML or SGML files as input.

Subject: [dm-l] Multiple streams / stages of footnotes: what solutions?

Dear list,
As those of you who have had the pleasure to tackle critical editions in 
printed form, the traditional
mutiple streams or "stages" of footnotes (variants + biblical references 
+ sources, for instance) are a real pain, and very few solutions are 
offered.

I knew of two, mainly (leaving aside InDesign and the like): LaTex (for 
the bold and slightly geeky critical editor with time on his hands), and 
the Classical Text Editor, an apparently quite interesting text editor 
dedicated to critical editions (unfortunately rather expensive).

I have just discovered that, apparently, a word processor for MacOSX is 
capable of handling those multiple layers:

See also for a more detailed explanation of the footnotes features p. 
111- 124 in the PDF manual:

Unfortunately, I have no MacOsX at hand for the moment, and haven't been 
able to give this word processor a test yet. But I would be very 
interested to hear from the DM-L list members, if ever some of you had 
tried this Mellel software.

More generally, do some of you use other solutions to handle multiple 
streams of footnotes in their *printed* editions, and what is your 
assesment of the various solutions?

Best, Marjorie
