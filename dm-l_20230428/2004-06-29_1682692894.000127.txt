Subject: Re: Re: [dm-l] palaeography and computing

I strongly believe that a palaeographic description can not leave aside 
the image of the manuscript. That's why, in this perspective, the 
image-based edition is the most intresting one.

However a sort of textual organised description could be imagined. For 
instance, a "b" has usually a bow and a vertical stroke. Like a 
database with determined fields, to which add content information, the 
same could probably be though for a set of letters in a certain style.

It was an interesting experience - paleographers seem to have different terms to describe the same forms, and I found that many terms were rather vague and only made sense when I actually saw the letter in question (ascender "rises well above the bow" or "projects slightly to the left"). And these lengthy descriptions are not always suitable as markup.
