Subject: Re: [dm-l] Proposed Changes to DM

I think the only caveat that needs to be mentioned in all this is that 
the location of the journal is not a fully autonomous decision--or at 
least if it is, it potentially involves giving up as much as $7k+ a year 
in in-kind and cash funding.

Currently the journal is managed within the Lethbridge journal 
incubator. This is a start up Open Access publisher that provides about 
$7k in in-kind funding in the form of managing assistance plus some cash 
for odd jobs.

This has been by no means perfect--we had an assistant dean try to kill 
it this past year before she fully understood just how strongly her 
boss, the dean of the graduate school, stood behind it. The result was 
that she severely restricted our access to funds for several months 
until we were able to get her countermanded. And, frankly, we also had 
trouble finding the right balance in relations between the students we 
had been able to supply and the editorial board.

The first of these issues has now been cleared up: we've been promised 
four positions a year for the foreseeable future and the incubator is 
moving from a prototype to an official and centrally supported Centre 
within the University in the course of the next six months.

The second certainly improved somewhat during the past year, though that 
has been with me largely acting as the graduate student, since the 
previous student quit in the face of the pressure she was placed under 
(when a grad student turns down 7k, you know there is an issue).

All this, however, is by-the-by. The issue now is whether the 
contribution from us is worth continuing and, if it is, how our ability 
to deliver it is affected by the system DM moves to (unlike all other 
journals in the system DM doesn't contribute anything back to the 
incubator, except, I had originally hoped, some willingness to help 
train the students in it).

Another thing that I have suggested to the board is that there is a lot 
of hype around various platforms. While they can definitely be an 
improvement over DM's current handrolled site, they are often far less 
comprehensive than their developers claim. Stock OJS, for example, 
builds itself as a all-in-one solution, but it is actually a very heavy 
workflow manager and publication platform that doesn't necessarily 
support two essential aspects of DM's production: despite what many 
people seem to think, it does not support at all the 
word-processor-to-delivery-format conversion that lies at the heart of 
any journal (though a recent module apparently supports Word-to-NLM 
XML). It also needs to be hacked severly to support DM's model of 
rolling release with special clusters: stock OJS sees "issues" (i.e. 
clusters of papers) as a sequence and its automatic Table of Content 
generator doesn't allow two issues to be kept open at the same time 
(Digital Studies/Le champ NumÃ©rique, which takes a similar approach to 
issues as DM, but within OJS, has had to give up on the TOC generator 
entirely. Its front page is actually hand coded). A study by the Public 
Knowledge Partnership OJS's developer actually suggested, moreover, that 
the OJS workflow model may be better suited to larger journals than very 
small ones like DM.

I understand that the core of revues.org is based on a modified OJS 
install. I don't know if it now supports automatic word to XML 
conversion (it didn't when we initially set up the Journal of the TEI) 
nor do I know if it has addressed the structural issue about how OJS 
handles issues. But what we did learn in setting both J-TEI up in 
revues.org and DSCN in an inherited OJS install was that both systems 
over-promised and under-delivered on what was the bit of the production 
workflow that people found most technically challenging.

So research is absolutely required on this: I know of a couple of 
journals that switched to OJS because they thought it would address 
technical issues they were having, only to discover it solved everything 
but those technical issues. On the other hand, both systems are a vast 
improvement over the current in terms of improving discoverability.

Anyway, this is a long way of saying that, having been involved now with 
at least four journals and professionally engaged as a researcher and 
member of the administration of force11.org, I've come to the conclusion 
that changing any journal's delivery, production, and workflow 
management systes can prove to be a very complicated undertaking. I 
agree wholeheartedly that it is time to reexamine what DM is doing. But 
I also know that people regularly under-estimate and misunderstand what 
the issues are, that systems that support journals (including, I 
acknowledge this past year, the incubator) regularly over-promise what 
they can do, and that the implications of the decision can be quite 
significant from both a funding and a bibliographic perspective.

Having said all that, I will add that my one feelings about changing the 
journals are limited to a hope that the change is well-researched and 
fully understood, no matter what it is. If that means keeping the 
journal within our financing and management model, which is certainly 
compatible with OJS or home-rolled systems (the three journals we 
currently host use two completely different home-rolled systems and one 
OJS install), I'm all for it. If it means abandoning the current 
incubator model, I'm cool with that too. The important thing is that 
people realise the costs and benefits of whatever is proposed.
