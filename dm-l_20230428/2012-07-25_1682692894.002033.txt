Subject: [dm-l] Inquisitions Post Mortem (1236-1509) project seeks your views

The Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London is 
undertaking a short information gathering exercise for a resource that 
is likely to be of great use to those studying fifteenth century England.

The project is concerned with Inquisitions Post Mortem (IPMs), which are 
records of the lands held at death by tenants of the crown.  Thousands 
of IPMs are held at the National Archives, and some have been 
calendared.  Our project will make the IPMs from 1236 to 1509 a freely 
accessible digital resource for historians, genealogists, and other 
interested parties.

We would very much value the input of experts in the field to ensure 
that we create a resource that best meets the needs of its users.  If 
you would be interested in completing a brief questionnaire about the 
resource, please visit the IPM blog for more information:

The questionnaire will be open until Friday 3rd August.  If you have any

With many thanks,
