Subject: Re: [dm-l] Cocoon authentication--anybody with experience?

Hi Dan,

I don't think Cocoon supports anything as simple as .htaccess, but my  
experience with it is a bit dated.  It isn't terribly hard to set up  
an authentication system for it if you know Java--basically you create  
some sort of Action that does your authentication/authorization and  
then wrap the pipelines you want protected in that.

You get a lot out of the box with frameworks like Django, but I think  
you're right that there would be a lot to learn and rebuild if you've  
already got a working system.

So if your needs are simple right now, why not just use .htpasswd?   
It's fairly easy to set up Apache as a front to Tomcat, using mod_jk  
(see http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/generic_howto/ 
quick.html), and then you can do it the way you're used to.
