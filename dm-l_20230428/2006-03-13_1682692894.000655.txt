I add few links :
- one link for manuscript description : the summary of reviews of the 
manuscript description chapter : 
http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/MS/msw05.xml
- links for manuscript transcription : a new electronic edition in TEI 
P4 by Ecole des chartes : les chroniques latines de Saint-Denis : 
http://elec.enc.sorbonne.fr/chroniqueslatines/ and two guidelines in 
french (vive le multinlinguisme :-) ) to encode medieval deeds (It's an 
handwritten source too !).
We are beginning a project in Ecole des chartes to make an inventory of 
translations in vernacular language of classical texts and we use the 
new manuscript Description module that is very good answer for our 
needs. I hope we can propose the guidelines of this work for the autumn.
I hope this few links and informations will be able to help you
