The thing that would be 
most helpful, actually, is a universally accepted "controlled 
vocabulary" for paleographic description, either verbal or in terms of 
graphical metrics (or ideally both), on which we could build descriptive 
structures in XML or whatever. I don't think paleographers are close to 
having that.

Last year I went through the introductions to several Old English facsimiles (Vercelli Book, Hatton 20, Junius 11, Royal 7 C xii; and Ker's Catalogue - whatever was easily available at UK) in an attempt to glean such a controlled vocabulary. It was an interesting experience - paleographers seem to have different terms to describe the same forms, and I found that many terms were rather vague and only made sense when I actually saw the letter in question (ascender "rises well above the bow" or "projects slightly to the left"). And these lengthy descriptions are not always suitable as markup.
