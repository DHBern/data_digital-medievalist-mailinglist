CALL FOR PAPERS
Script, print and letterforms in global contexts:
the visual and the material

28-29 June 2018
Birmingham City University

Deadline for proposals: 15 November 2017

In this conference, we seek to explore the plurality of engagements 
with, and interpretations of the printed and written word in various 
writing systems and artefacts; whether handwritten, lithographed, 
typographically printed, or digitally conjured. We invite both scholars 
and practitioners, broadly in the areas of design, printing, publishing, 
typography, print culture and book history, to bring critical 
perspectives and present fresh approaches to the study and discussion of 
the visual and material aspects of print in the diverse linguistic 
contexts of the world.
  The global history of text-based communication constitutes a 
particularly exciting facet of material culture, given the myriad ways 
in which its production, transmission, and consumption has been (and 
continues to be) accomplished across cultural and political boundaries. 
However, a critical engagement with script and print outside the western 
world has remained relatively limited despite a burgeoning interest in 
the interrelated areas of printing, publishing, design, and type 
history. Studies of the ‘global’ and ‘regional’ cultures of print have 
tended to accommodate summary accounts and generalisations in relation 
to the material production of text in different languages and scripts, 
most commonly grouped under the term ‘non-Latin’. The time is long 
overdue for these narratives to expand, and address the rich variation 
and particularity of global practices.
  THEMES
Possible themes for the conference include, but are not limited to:
	●  Print, manuscript, and material culture from around the world;
	●  Global and transnational histories of printing, publishing, 
technology, typography and type design;
	●  Cultural and political dynamics in the visual/material 
representation of scripts and languages;
	●  Social, political, and economic aspects shaping printing and 
publishing practices;
	●  Networks and exchanges between or within print and manuscript 
communities: Including but not limited to business, cultural, 
educational, and literary aspects;
	●  Connections and interactions between various actors and entities: 
Including but not limited to, artists, designers, linguists, 
manufacturers, readers, scholars, technologists, users, 
assembly/production-line workers;
	●  Perspectives on technological change in the history of design, 
printing, technology, and typography: Including but not limited to 
innovation, adaptation, resistance, and use;
	●  Forms, formats, and usage of documents and publications composed in 
global scripts: Including substrates besides paper; letters on stones, 
wood, fabric, ceramics, or digital media.
  PAPERS of twenty-minutes in duration are invited for this 
international conference from independent researchers, established 
scholars and postgraduate students, as well as artists, designers and 
practitioners working in the fields of history, book history, printing 
history, type design, typographic history and design, and print, 
manuscript, and material culture.
