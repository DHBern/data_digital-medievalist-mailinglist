Dear digital medievalists,

We are happy to announce the publication of two new articles in the  
Journal of Digital Medievalist, issue 10 (2015):

"From 'anhelitus' to 'hanellissement': Cross-referencing in the  
Anglo-Norman dictionary" by Katariina Nara-Zanotti:

and Douglas Hayes:

Digital Medievalist operates a policy of rolling release, meaning that  
articles are published as soon as they are available.

In the same issue (10) the article by Ludger Zeevaert on "Easy tools  
to get to grips with linguistic variation in the manuscripts of Njáls  
saga" has previously been published July 10th, 2015:
