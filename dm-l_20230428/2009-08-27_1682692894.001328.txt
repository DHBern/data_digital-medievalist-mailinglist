Subject: [dm-l] Seeking presenter for a DRHA paperApologies for a rather off-topic request, but I'm looking for someone
who will be attending the Digital Resources in Humanities and Arts
conference in Belfast, who would be willing and able to present the
work of someone else who will be unable to attend a session I've
organized. The session description is here:
http://dho.ie/drha2009/programme/abstracts#paper-cto. To be clear, you
wouldn't be presenting your own work but the (rather technical,
computer-science-y) work of someone who is unable to attend._redacted_(a)gmail.comThanks,
Dot--
