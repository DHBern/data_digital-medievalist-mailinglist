Is this necessarily the case?  Couldn't you simply output these 
fragments as individual page files - so only having to do the process 
once?  I agree with you whole-heartedly that XSLT is problematic for 
choosing to display from one arbitrary point to another arbitrary point 
in the XML, but your points aren't arbitrary.  Page breaks will be the 
same each time, so I don't see the need to do this dynamically.  Store 
your full versions of Hengwrt, and also store files created for each 
page, searching the former, but displaying the latter.  Just because we 
*can* dynamically pull out a single page from the whole of a large XML 
file doesn't mean we *have* to.

I'd of course encourage people to do so as well, Anastasia is a great 
tool and it is wonderful that it has been made open source.
