[apologies for cross-posting]

Dear colleagues,

we are very happy to announce the first joint publication of RIDE
(Review Journal for Digital Editions) and the NFDI consortium Text+
(https://www.text-plus.org/). The NFDI is the German National Research
Data Infrastructure (https://www.nfdi.de/) intiative which was
launched in 2020 and is working to shape the future of research data
management in Germany across all disciplines through dedicated
consortia. Since 2021, the NFDI Text+ consortium is dedicated to the
domain of text- and language-based data, particularly collections,
lexical resources, and scholarly editions.

In volume 16 (https://ride.i-d-e.de/issues/issue-16/) of RIDE, five
editions were reviewed with a specific focus on the FAIR Data
Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). What does
FAIRness mean in the context of digital scholarly editions? Can the
FAIR principles be applied to digital edition projects at all? How do
we measure their FAIRness? This volume aims to foster a conversation
about these questions.

While the majority of the editions under review may not be editions of
medieval materials (although the Königsfelden edition is), we believe
that the topic may still be of interest to the editorial community at
large.

The following contributions are included in volume 16:

* Gengnagel, Tessa; Neuber, Frederike; Schulz, Daniela. „EDITORIAL:
FAIR Enough? Evaluating Digital Scholarly Editions and the Application
of the FAIR Data Principles." RIDE 16 (2023). doi:
https://doi.org/10.18716/ride.a.16.0.
* Untner, Laura. „Review of ‚Walter Benjamin Digital'." RIDE 16
(2023). doi: https://doi.org/10.18716/ride.
a.16.1.
* Galka, Selina. „Review of ‚Digitale Edition und Kommentierung der
Tagebücher des Fürsten Christian II. von Anhalt-Bernburg
(1599-1656)'." RIDE 16 (2023). doi:
https://doi.org/10.18716/ride.a.16.2.
* Görmar, Maximilian. „Review of ‚Briefportal Leibniz'." RIDE 16
(2023). doi: https://doi.org/10.18716/ride.a.16.3.
* Frühwirt, Timo; Meyer, Sandra; Stoxreiter, Daniel. „Review of
‚Theodor Fontane's Notebooks: A 'Digital Genetic-Critical and

* Pollin, Christopher. „A Review of the Königsfelden Online Edition."
RIDE 16 (2023). doi: https://doi.org/10.18716/ride.a.16.5.

A second joint volume, again with a focus on the FAIR principles, is
already under way and can be expected to be published later this
spring in a "rolling release". Suggestions for reviews or interest in
becoming a reviewer can still be expressed to the editors via
ride-textplus[at]i-d-e.de (see also the Call for Reviews:
https://ride.i-d-e.de/reviewers/call-for-reviews/ride-textplus-en/).

Enjoy the (FAIR) RIDE!

On behalf of the editorial team,
Tessa Gengnagel, Frederike Neuber and Daniela Schulz
