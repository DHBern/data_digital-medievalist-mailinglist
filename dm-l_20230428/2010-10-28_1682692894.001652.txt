At first glance the decision seems to be to the contrary:

   Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp., 36 F. Supp. 2d 191
   (S.D.N.Y. 1999), was a decision by the United States District Court
   for the Southern District of New York, which ruled that exact
   photographic copies of public domain images could not be protected
   by copyright in the United States because the copies lack
   originality.
