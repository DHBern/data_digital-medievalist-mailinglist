Subject: [dm-l] DM Elections: Final Reminder

Dear all,

This is a final reminder for you to vote in the DM Elections. The ballot closes tomorrow (Sunday, July 4), and experience has shown that even one vote could make the difference, so we urge you to please vote if you have not done so already.

To remind you, there are 4 vacancies on the board and 8 candidates. Eligible voters may vote for up to four candidates. Candidate biographies are available at <http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/election2010/> and the ballot is available at <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/YFN6TLW>. In order to check eligibility, voters will be asked to supply the email address they use for their subscription to dm-l. This information will not be used for any other purpose, and will be discarded after the election.

Thanks again,

Peter Stokes and Dan O'Donnell
