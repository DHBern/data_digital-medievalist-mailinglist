Since the earliest times, new technologies have contributed to profound scientific advances and have transformed the ways we can do research. It is claimed today that the World Wide Web offers revolutionary models of scientific cooperation, which promise to instantiate a utopian democracy of knowledge. This claim has repeatedly been associated with the development and introduction of a collaborative Web, commonly referred to as 'Web 2.0' as well as its offspring, a semantically enriched Web 3.0 still in the making The aim of this conference is to bring together art historians and other researchers (including digital humanists) in order to investigate the intersection between the web and collaborative research processes, via an examination of electronic media-based cooperative models in the history of art and beyond. 
The conference will not only be an occasion to exchange ideas and present relevant projects in the field, but,with contributions spanning from art history (and digital art) to philosophy and cultural studies, from psychology and sociology of knowledge to computer graphics, from semiotics to curatorial practices it will offer a unique forum for the representation of both diversified and complementary approaches to the topic of Networked humanities.
