Subject: [dm-l] TEI Conference 2012: Late-breaking call

With usual apologies for cross-posting
 
========================

As in the previous years, the Programme Committee for the TEI Members Meeting in College Station (Texas) has reserved some limited slots on the program for late breaking submissions. 
Please notice that these submissions, although evaluated by the programme committee, do not undergo the normal peer review process and therefore will only be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings after further peer review. Otherwise the requirements and proposal formats are very similar; details of the call for paper  can be found at the conference web page

http://idhmc.tamu.edu/teiconference/ 

We hope that the announcement of this possibility will come as a relief to those who missed the
deadline of the first round of submissions, but still would like to have a
chance to contribute to the program of the meeting.

The deadline for late breaking submissions is the 1st of October 2012. You can submit your proposal via conftool:

http://www.tei-c.org/conftool/

There will also be an exciting slate of pre-conference workshops to be announced really soon now, so please watch this space, or the conference website for further information.

For the programme committee,

Elena Pierazzo
