Subject: [dm-l] Call for Papers: Digital Humanities in Biblical Studies and

Dear all, with apologies for cross-posting,

The SBL program group "Digital Humanities in Biblical Studies and Early Jewish and Christian Studies" would like to advertise a call for papers for its sessions at the International SBL meeting, jointly with the European Association of Biblical Studies, in Vienna from 6-10th July 2014.

We expect papers on:
(1) The creation and structuring of digital data representing the texts and artefacts relevant to Biblical Studies, Early Jewish Studies and Early Christian Studies

(2) The digital analysis of said data (linguistics, stylometrics, stemmatology, network analysis, etc.), the presentation, rendering and visualisation of data and its analysis, and critical analysis of the social and cultural aspects of the digitisation of research and society in relation to the aforementioned texts and artefacts.

For more information and to submit a proposal, please see the following webpage (mind the wrap):

The unit chairs can also be contacted there, although I too will be happy to respond to any questions. The deadline is 4th February 2014.

Many thanks,
Hugh Houghton
