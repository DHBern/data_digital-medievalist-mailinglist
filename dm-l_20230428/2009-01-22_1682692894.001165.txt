Subject: [dm-l] Suggestions for pre-web digital medieval studies

Dear List,

In 2009, the Digital Medievalist Journal will be publishing a special
issue on the lessons learned from pre-web digital medieval projects.
The editors have compiled a list of scholars we will be inviting to
submit articles for this issue, however we feel the list as it stands
is rather Anglo-centric. We are turning to the list to suggest
potential authors - either scholars who themselves developed pre-web
projects, or who have studied such projects with an historical view.
We would especially like the names of non-US, non-Canadian, and
non-English scholars. Please send suggestions to the DM list, or
_redacted_(a)digitalmedievalist.org).

Many thanks,
Dot
