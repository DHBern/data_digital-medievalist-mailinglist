Vienna, Austria, November 3 - 05, 2014
Deadline: Jul 11, 2014

SPECIAL CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSION:

“The State of 3D Modeling of Cultural Heritage
in the Age of Augmented Reality, Xbox Kinect, UAVs, and the Oculus Rift”

at the Conference on Cultural Heritage and New Technologies (CHNT: 
http://www.chnt.at/), Vienna, Nov. 3-5, 2014

The purpose of this session is to take stock of the current state of 
the art of 3D modeling of cultural heritage objects of all scales (from 
a vase or statue, to a building or an entire landscape). It seems 
particularly opportune to do so in light of the dramatically lower 
costs of devices for 3D data capture and display. Papers fitting one or 
more of the following three descriptions would be especially welcome: 
(1) cultural heritage projects exploiting Augmented Reality and/or 
immersive, 3D display devices such as the Oculus Rift
(2) projects collecting 3D data using low-cost devices and methods such 
as SfM, Kinect or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(3) 3D modeling projects (especially those involving reconstructions) 
that have as their goal not simply illustrating previously existing 
knowledge of the past but serving as tools to see or understand 
features of the past that can only emerge after we have made the 3D 
model. Papers should concentrate less on the “how” of 3D modeling 
(fairly well understood by now) than on the “why” (i.e., what is the 
scientific gain in knowledge that results from applying the new 
technology?).

Topics falling into category (1) should, whenever possible, provide the 
results of summative assessment: we are interested not simply in bright 
ideas and clever demonstrations but in proof of concept or full-scale 
deployment. For example, if a  claim is made that AR can help promote 
better public understanding of cultural heritage, did the pilot AR 
project actually produce measurably positive results?

Topics falling into category (2) should ideally include a comparison of 
the results of using low-cost and high-end data gathering devices. What 
are the strengths and weaknesses of the low-cost approach? Is a 
low-cost device good for certain cultural heritage applications but not 
others? For example, we welcome a paper comparing the resolution and 
accuracy of 3D meshes of a statue resulting from a SfM approach vs. one 
resulting from traditional scanning.
Papers of two lengths are invited: short (fifteen minutes, or less); 
and long (twenty minutes). Applicants should indicate the length of 
time they would need for their presentation.

Each paper, no matter its length, will be followed by five minutes of 
discussion and debate. To facilitate a lively discussion of the papers 
in Vienna, all participants are required to circulate a written draft 
of their talks to the other participants no later than October 1, 2014.

The papers accepted will be published as a special issue in Digital 
Applications in Archaeology and Cultural Heritage, a new online, 
peer-reviewed journal started in 2012 by the organizers. For details, 
see: 
http://www.journals.elsevier.com/digital-applications-in-archaeology-and-cultural-heritage/

Abstracts of a minimum of 200 words to a maximum of 300 words must be 
submitted by noon CET on Friday, July 11, 2014. Abstracts should be 
filed online at: http://www.chnt.at/call-for-paper/ 
 
Inquiries should be directed to the session organizers: Bernard 
_redacted_(a)gmail.com) and Gabriele Guidi 
_redacted_(a)ieee.org).
