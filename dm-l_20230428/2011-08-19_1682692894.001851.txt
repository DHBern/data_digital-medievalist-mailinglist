RESEARCH FELLOW ON THE PAUL COMMENTARIES PROJECT

A research fellow is being sought to work on a new project scheduled  
to begin this autumn analysing the biblical text of the earliest  
commentaries on the Pauline Epistles in Greek and Latin.

The research fellow will be a member of a team led by Dr Hugh Houghton  
and based at the Institute for Textual Scholarship and Electronic  
Editing in Birmingham ( www.birmingham.ac.uk/itsee ). He or she will  
examine early biblical commentaries of the fourth and fifth centuries,  
comparing them with their manuscript tradition and related works. The  
work will involve identifying and adding relevant material to the  
project database and making electronic transcriptions of primary  
sources.

Candidates should have a doctoral degree in a relevant subject,  
excellent linguistic ability in Latin or Greek and very good computer  
skills. As it says in the advertisement, an eye for detail and good  
self-motivation to persist with repetitive and sometimes tedious text- 
critical work are essential!

The post is full-time and fixed-term, initially for three years. The  
closing date is 14th September 2011.

Further details may be found at http://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/ADC511/ and http://www.epistulae.org/ 
  which both have links to the job description and online application  
form.
