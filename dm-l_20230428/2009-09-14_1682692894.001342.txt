Dear all,

Thanks to those of you who filled in this quick straw poll.  It came
out just as I expected, with the  clear majority of those answering
saying that their CMS was something like "Some CMS staff, but mostly
co-opted faculty from other humanities departments".

Does anyone know of any real surveys of this type of thing? Perhaps by the MAA?

Thanks again,
