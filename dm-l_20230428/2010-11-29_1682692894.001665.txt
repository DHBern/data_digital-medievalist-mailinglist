The Department of Classics and the Department of Religious Studies at
The University of Iowa invite applications for a joint-appointment,
tenure-track position at the assistant professor level in any aspect
of Religion in the Ancient Mediterranean (1st century c.e. to 9th c.
c.e.) with a demonstrated interest in Digital Humanities, to begin in
August 2011. Salary is dependent on candidate's experience and
credentials.Details at http://jobs.uiowa.edu/faculty/view/58610Interesting to see that Digital Humanities may lurk beneath a job
title that doesn't necessarily suggest them! Also interesting to note
the time-span to be covered.C
