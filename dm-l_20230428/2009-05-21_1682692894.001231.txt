    Call for Bids: TEI Conference and Members Meeting, 2010

The annual TEI Conference and Members' Meeting takes place every year in 
late October or early November. We are now seeking bids to host this 
event in 2010.

The meeting this year (2009) will take place on November 11-15 at the 
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI, USA. The previous meetings have 
been:

    * London, England, November 6-8, 2008. hosted by King's College London.
    * College Park (MD), USA, October 31-November 3, 2007. Hosted by the
      University of Maryland.
    * Victoria, Canada, October 27-28, 2006. Hosted by the University of
      Victoria.
    * Sophia, Bulgaria, October 28-29, 2005. Hosted by the Bulgarian
      Academy of Sciences.
    * Baltimore, USA, October 22-23, 2004. Hosted by Johns Hopkins
      University.
    * Nancy, France, November 7-8 2003. Hosted by ATILF.
    * Chicago, USA, October 11-12 2002. Hosted by the Newberry Library
      and Northwestern University.
    * Pisa, Italy, November 16-17 2001. Hosted by the University of Pisa.

The site of the conference and meeting has typically alternated between 
Europe and North America, but that is not a fixed rule. We welcome 
proposals from other parts of the world, and in particular from areas 
where new TEI communities are arising.

This year's conference and meeting will be a four-day event (plus 
pre-conference workshops), with approximately 120 attendees. The three 
days of the main conference will include a mix of plenary lectures by 
invited speakers, round-table discussions, and conference-style 
sessions; there will also be a business meeting of the membership. The 
fourth day (Sunday) will be a closed session for members of the Board. 
Meetings of TEI Special Interest Groups (SIGs) may also scheduled for 
this day. Future meetings should assume roughly this shape, although 
there is considerable room for local initiative in consultation with the 
Board.

The TEI Consortium guarantees direct costs of the conference and meeting 
up to a maximum of US$5200 with special provisions for funding 
attendance in excess of approximately 120 attendees. The conference 
organising committee is also expected to seek additional funds from 
local institutions, commercial sponsors, and other organisations. A 
conference registration fee is charged to assist the TEI in recovering 
its expenditure and ensure that it is able to underwrite the cost of 
future conferences.

    * The name of the institution(s) making the bid

    * A brief description of the facilities available for the event
      (rooms, equipment, technical support, food)

      institution is prepared to give (for instance, sponsoring one or
      more receptions or pre-meeting workshops; payment of travel
      expenses for one or more plenary speakers; etc.)
    * Any other details that may be useful in assessing the bid (e.g.
      the presence of a conference on a related topic at the institution
      around the time of the meeting; the launch of a new TEI-related
      initiative at the institution, etc., ideas for a particular theme
      or focus).

In submitting bids, local organisers are encouraged to be creative: the 
TEI is willing to work with hosts to reflect local interests and strengths.

members meeting may be found in our document on Hosting a Members 
Meeting <http://www.tei-c.org/Membership/Meetings/meeting_hosting.xml>
