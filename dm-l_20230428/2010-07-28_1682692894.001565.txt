Subject: Re: [dm-l] Question about preservation of digital content

Stuart Lee and I wrote an article that touched on this a little in Gail 
Owen's book on Anglo-Saxon Manuscripts. And I had a couple of brief 
columns on different aspects of the problem Heroic Age a little while back.

I'm not 100% sure I share your premises, BTW. I think most things from 
1995 would still be recoverable, if you knew the right software. I 
recently helped a colleague restore a whole bunch of very old 
WordPerfect files using Open Office. And while I've not tried a 1995 
.doc file in it, I'd be amazed if it couldn't read it.

My rule of thumb is anything for a PC or Mac is recoverable, no matter 
how old, unless it is in a minor proprietary format. So most image 
files, most WordPerfect and Word files, I'm guessing most Wordstar files 
should be fine. I'd have my doubts about ChiWriter files, though that 
might have been a pre-PC program for the SuperPet. As a rule, you're 
better off in recovery with something like OpenOffice, since the stakes 
surrounding compatibility are much higher for them than for proprietary 
software like Word: people use Word whether or not it reads other 
formats, but nobody would use OpenOffice if it didn't read Word. In face 
in the case of old .doc files, Open Office was a better interpreter than 
Word: when I was typesetting Caedmon's Hymn, which I did in Word from 
SGML masters, I had some trouble where Word would get confused in 
displaying complex tables. Opening the files in OO and then saving them 
immediately as Word Files again was usually enough to solve the problem.

It is useful to read Nicholas Barker on preservation anxiety, BTW. I 
think a lot of what he says about misplaced fears of obsolescence with 
regard to 19th Century paper is also true of things like CD-ROMs and 
file formats. You'd be amazed how much works just fine.
