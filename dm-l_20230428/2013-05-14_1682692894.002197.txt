Subject: [dm-l] Biblissima - Survey : XML editors for TEI/EAD

Dear all,

As part of the Biblissima project, we are carrying out a survey on the user requirements for XML editors, especially for people doing TEI and/or EAD encoding. We would like to find out more about your habits and wishes, in order to develop tools that are best-suited to your needs. If you are involved with this kind of work, we would be pleased if you could answer our survey :

We invite you to transmit it as widely as possible to your colleagues, students or friends who use XML editor whether regularly or occasionally in the digital humanities.

With our grateful thanks,

The biblissima team.
