Subject: [dm-l] Dark Archives conference, Oxford

Dear Colleagues,

I have been asked to draw your attention to the following conference in 
Oxford in September 2019: http://aevum.space/darkarchives

Although the deadline is 31 December, at this stage they simply need an 
expression of interest and an idea for a paper; the abstract can follow 
later!

With all best wishes,

Julie
