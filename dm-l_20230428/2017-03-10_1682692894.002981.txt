Subject: [dm-l] 2 post-doc contracts for DH in Medieval Studies in Paris

Dear all, 

This might be of interest to some of our members. The CNRS is offering 2 post-doctoral contracts (2 years, plus 1 optional year) for DH projects. Since the successful candidates wil be affected to the IRHT, a famous research centre in Medieval Studies (also Early Modern), this is of particular interest for Digital Medievalists:
