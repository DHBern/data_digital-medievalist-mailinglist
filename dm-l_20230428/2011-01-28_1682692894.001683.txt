It is probably my limited knowledge of XSLT, but I find it quite difficult to do things with data in an XML structure (other than rearranging and displaying it).

I find the way variables work in XSLT just so cumbersome. I wouldn't know where to start doing complex regex operations in XLST, to be honest.
