Subject: Re: [dm-l] Find Glyph

I thought I'd take a look at this, so I down-loaded it.  Then after I 
unzipped it, I got a message from the program telling me I had to let it 
rewrite part of my OS before it could run! Of course I deleted the thing 
at once.  That isn't the way things ought to work....
