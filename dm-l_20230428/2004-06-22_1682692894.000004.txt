Subject: Re: [dm-l] Experience using Microsoft's XSLT? and Is there a good

Dan,

I believe that MSXSL (the Microsoft XSLT processor) got a reputation for 
implementing the standard poorly when Microsoft jumped the gun and 
included it in Internet Explorer 5 before the standard was final. W3C 
made significant changes in the standard after that, leaving many IE5 
users high and dry. I don't use MSXSL myself, but my understanding is 
that more recent versions are standards compliant, and it may even be 
one of the better XSLT processors.

MSXSL does have extensions, which you need to avoid if you want a script 
to be portable; but then so do the Apache and Saxon processors. Everyone 
is supposed to use a different namespace for their extensions 
(Microsoft's is msxsl:), and that makes them easy to identify. But the 
presence of extensions does not make the processor non-standard, as long 
as they are implemented in the right way.
