Subject: Digitisation in a Day: CrowdsourcingAn Foras Feasa is delighted to announce two 'Digitisation in a Day'
workshops organised this term by Maynooth University. The workshops will
focus on crowdsourcing (24th February) and 3D recording (12th March)
offering hands-on experience on a diverse range of methods and
technologies applied to humanities and cultural heritage, while
providing an overview of past, present and future practices, debates and
challenges.The crowdsourcing workshop will focus particularly on the use of TEI,
particularly in terms of user-generated encoding.Please note that spaces are limited and  registration is on a
first-come, first-served basis. Concessionary fees and bursaries are
available to those coming from educational and heritage backgrounds.To find more information and register for the events please visit:
