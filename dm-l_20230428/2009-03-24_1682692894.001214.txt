Subject: [dm-l] Experience with scholarly society ecommerce?

Hi all (sorry for cross posting),

This is a TAN, but the group here is very likely to have some of the 
experience I'm looking for.

At the TEI, we are investigating ways of automating subscriber, member, 
and conference registration with an eye to accepting credit cards and 
preparing the ground for some additional members benefits. Currently, 
the software we are looking at most intensely is Zencart, an open source 
PHP- and MySQL-based shopping cart system that is well supposed by 
Credit Card redemption companies. We can get it to do most of what we 
want, but there are some odd bits: for example it seems to be impossible 
to get it to stop shouting about the fact that we are offering free 
shipping on your memberships and conference subscription. And of course 
there is maintenance overhead associated with any complex software.

This makes me wonder if a full shopping cart might be more than we need. 
Does anybody have experience at any of their various projects and/or 
societies with setting up membership and conference registration, 
preferably with the option to accept credit cards?

Since this is TAN, please contact me offlist!
