Subject: [dm-l] PostDoc in Digital Humanities at Passau

Dear list,

I am searching for a postdoctoral research and teaching fellow to join the newly established Digital Humanities team in the beautiful city of Passau (Bavaria, Germany). I am offering a three-years full-time contract (with possible renewal, six years max.) and the possibility to conduct your own research on fundamental methodology of DH. German is not a requirement for international candidates. You are welcome to apply and also to teach in English and contribute to Passau University's growing international programme.

Have at look at the job posting for more details (http://www.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/dokumente/beschaeftigte/Stellenangebote/2013_04_Post-doctoral_Prof_Rehbein_engl.pdf) and get in touch with me if you have any questions. Deadline for applications: 20 May. 

Best regards,
Malte
