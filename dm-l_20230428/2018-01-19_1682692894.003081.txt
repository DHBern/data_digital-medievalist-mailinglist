* Call for Open Science workshops in DHN2018 (March 9, 2018) *

The overarching theme of DHN2018 is Open Science. This pragmatic concept 
emphasises the role of transparent and reproducible research practices, 
open dissemination of results, and new forms of collaboration, all 
greatly facilitated by digitalisation. Conference participants have been 
invited to specifically highlight aspects of Open Science in the 
submitted work.

A call is now open for workshops that emphasize themes relevant to Open 
Science. The workshops will take place on March 9, 2018 in Tiedekulma, 
parallel to the main event. We are looking for proposals on any aspects 
or activities that are relevant for Open Science. Examples of 
appropriate formats include, but are not limited to, academic seminar, 
hackathon, or a public outreach event.

_redacted_(a)iki.fi 
(DHN2018 Open Science chair) by Feb 5, 2018. Kindly include a brief 
description of the event, anticipated number of participants, session 
timing (up to a full-day event), and contact information of the 
organizer/s. You can also contact us to discuss the proposal in more 
detail before submission.
