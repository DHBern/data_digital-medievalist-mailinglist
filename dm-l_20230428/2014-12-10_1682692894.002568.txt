Subject: [dm-l] Reviews on digital editions - RIDE 2 out now!

*** Apologies for cross-posting ***

Dear list,

I am very happy to announce that we just published issue 2 of RIDE, a  
review journal for digital editions and resources.

As in the first issue, we have 5 (4 English, 1 German) reviews that  
critically assess publicly available scholarly digital editions. Among  
these a review of the digital edition of the Becerro Galicano of San  
Millán de la Cogolla, one of the oldest medieval cartularies in Spain  
and one of the most important sources for the study of Christian Spain  
between the 8th and 12th century.

For your convenience, this is the table of contents:

• 16th Century Chronicle to 21st Century Edition: A Review of The  
Diary of Henry Machyn, by Misha Broughton,
• Der Zürcher Sommer 1968: Die digitale Edition, by Friederike Wein
• The Digital Edition of the Becerro Galicano de San Millán de la  
Cogolla, by Francisco Javier Álvarez Carbajal
• The Fleischmann Diaries, by Merisa A. Martinez
• The Shelley-Godwin Archive: The edition of Mary Shelley's  
Frankenstein Notebooks, by Frederike Neuber
