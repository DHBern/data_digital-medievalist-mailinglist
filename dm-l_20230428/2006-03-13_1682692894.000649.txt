Well, the easy way is to just have four output documents with links to switch
between them. I.e. edRunic.html dipRunic.html edRoman.html dipRoman.html and
when you generate the files just create links to the other files.  So, entirely
pre-processed.

If you want to do it dynamically, then you'll need something like Apache's
cocoon.  In the sitemap.xmap for that where you'd normally have something like:

<map:match pattern="*.html">
            <map:generate src="{1}.xml" />
            <map:transform src="file2html.xsl"/>
            <map:transform src="makePretty.xsl"/>
            <map:serialize encoding="UTF-8" type="xhtml"/>
</map:match>

Which would hypothetically generate a file at the url/*.html from the results of
putting whatever-filename-you-used.xml through file2html.xsl and then the result
of that through makePretty.xsl to give you your output.  Instead you'd need to
pass a parameter, something like:

 <map:match pattern="*.html">
        <map:select type="request">
          <map:parameter name="parameter-name" value="style"/>
          <map:when test="edRunic">
            <map:generate src="{1}.xml" />
            <map:transform src="edRunic.xsl"/>
            <map:serialize encoding="UTF-8" type="xml"/>
          </map:when>
          <map:when test="dipRunic">
            <map:generate src="{1}.xml" />
            <map:transform src="dipRunic.xsl"/>
            <map:serialize encoding="UTF-8" type="xml"/>
          </map:when>
          <map:when test="dipRoman">
            <map:generate src="{1}.xml" />
            <map:transform src="edRunic.xsl"/>
            <map:serialize encoding="UTF-8" type="xml"/>
          </map:when>
          <map:otherwise">
            <map:generate src="{1}.xml" />
            <map:transform src="edRoman.xsl"/>
            <map:serialize encoding="UTF-8" type="xml"/>
          </map:otherwise>
        </map:select>
 </map:match>

So if you did http://www.example.com/dan/foo.html you'd defaultly get the
edRoman transformation for foo.xml.  If you did
http://www.example.com/dan/foobar.html?style=dipRunic  you'd get the dipRunic
one, for foobar.xml, etc.

Probably not the answer you were looking for, but might be helpful since this is
the kind of thing that cocoon is really good at.
