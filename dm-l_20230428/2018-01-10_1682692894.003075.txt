Dear colleagues,

I'm sending you the doctoral researcher call (see below) on behalf of 
Saana Svärd, director of the Centre of Excellence in "Ancient Near 
Eastern Empires" at the University of Helsinki.

Best regards,
Jouni Tuominen

********************************************************************
ANEE is pleased to announce we are looking for doctoral candidates.
Application text below, link here:
<https://www.helsinki.fi/en/open-positions/doctoral-researchers-anee-1-3>

The Centre of Excellence in “Ancient Near Eastern Empires” (ANEE) at the 
University of Helsinki will run from 2018–2025 and is directed by Dr. 
Saana Svärd. ANEE asks: How do changing imperial dynamics impact social 
group identities and lifeways over a millennium? ANEE covers the 
Neo-Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, Persian, Hellenistic, and early Roman / 
Parthian Empires. ANEE engages with methodologically varied yet 
integrated research on the long-term processes by which social group 
identities and lifeways were negotiated. Taken together, the innovations 
of ANEE are the integrated longue durée approach; and the methodological 
innovativeness of each team (both separately and in collaboration). 
There will be several recruitment calls for fixed term positions during 
ANEE’s lifespan (doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and 
university researchers).

ANEE is now recruiting members for three teams which investigate 
identity-building processes. Each team has a methodologically specific 
approach yet collaborates on four work packages.

Applications are invited for DOCTORAL RESEARCHERS (1–3) for a fixed term 
of up to 4 years, starting on or before 1 September 2018 to work in the 
University of Helsinki. The successful candidates’ research projects 
will focus on the goals of a team or teams. The applicant should 
indicate to which team she/he is applying. The selected doctoral 
candidates will need to apply for acceptance in the graduate school for 
either the Faculty of Arts or Faculty of Theology in March 2018. Their 
main duties will consist of PhD studies and writing of a dissertation. 
As ANEE is deeply multidisciplinary, competence in more than one field 
and/or proof of successful scientific collaboration will be considered 
an advantage.

Team 1 “Digital Humanities Approaches” develops digital humanities 
approaches (especially social network analysis and language technology), 
using these to supplement the more traditional Assyriological 
approaches. Team 1 is looking for applicants with a solid background in 
Assyriology or a related field (within the
chronological scope of ANEE) and/or skills in Digital Humanities that 
can be put to use in relation to ANEE’s goals. Team 1 is led by Saana 
_redacted_(a)helsinki.fi).

Team 2 “Social Scientific Theory & Applications” tests and refines 
theoretical models from the social sciences for ancient evidence, 
integrating anthropological approaches to archaeology with sociological 
readings of textual and archaeological evidence. Team 2 seeks students 
with backgrounds in history of the Levant and/or the social sciences, 
and especially with an interest in migration, forced labor, and/or elite 
identities, and/or ancient historians of the Persian Empire with similar 
profiles. Willingness to collaborate with other teams and multiple work 
packages is desirable. Team 2 is led by Dr. Jason Silverman 
_redacted_(a)helsinki.fi).

Team 3 “Material Culture & Community Heritage” investigates the impact 
of each empire on ancient local communities inhabiting the imperial 
fringes and provides a sustainable future for this heritage. This it 
does through an archaeological field survey program in the ancient 
imperial fringe zone of southern Jordan and by developing a local 
community outreach program there. Our work in Finland revolves around 
promoting an understanding of Ancient Near Eastern heritage and
culture by developing a touring museum exhibition on the ancient Near 
East. The team also aims to collaborate with the Finnish authorities to 
further develop the policies and legislation regarding the trade in 
illicit antiquities. Team 3 seeks doctoral candidates in ANE 
archaeology, preferably with experience in GIS, remote sensing, and/or 
satellite analysis. Team 3 is led by Dr. Antti Lahelma 
_redacted_(a)helsinki.fi), who is also the vice-director of ANEE.

For more information on the three teams and the work packages, please 
see www.helsinki.fi/ancient-near-eastern-empires

An appointee to the position of doctoral researcher must hold a Master’s 
degree in a relevant field, and must subsequently be accepted as a 
doctoral candidate in the graduate school in the Faculty of Arts and/or 
Theology. The appointee must have the ability to conduct independent 
scientific research. Teaching or teaching-related tasks will form 5 % of 
the position. The candidate should have excellent analytical and 
methodological skills, and be able to work both independently and 
collaboratively as part of a multidisciplinary scientific community. The 
successful candidates are expected to have excellent skills in written 
and oral English. Skills in Finnish or Swedish are not required. 
Relocation costs can be negotiated and ANEE will offer help and 
information for the practicalities, if needed.
