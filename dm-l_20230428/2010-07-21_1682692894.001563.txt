Subject: [dm-l] Shameless self promotion

Hi all,

An op-ed I'd written for the Canadian Federation of Humanities and 
Social Sciences in response to the Canadian government's consultations 
on the digital economy was just placed by them today in the Edmonton 
Journal: http://bit.ly/aApodN

The argument is that today's internet is as much or more about use 
applications than engineering--and that Humanists and Social Scientists 
have played a pretty surprising role in its development and success.

Michael Everson: if you're on this list, I mention you by name ;)
