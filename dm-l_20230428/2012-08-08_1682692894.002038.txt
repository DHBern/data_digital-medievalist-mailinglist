Subject: [dm-l] DM Executive Roles

Dear all,

After today's meeting of the Digital Medievalist Executive Board, I am pleased to announce that we have confirmed or appointed people to the following roles:

Director: Peter Stokes
Journal Editor-in-Chief: Malte Rehbein
Journal Associate Editors: Dan O'Donnell, Orietta da Rold, Peter Stokes
Conference Representatives: Dominique Stutzman, Takako Kato
News Feed Administrators: Alexei Lavrentiev, Dominique Stutzman
DM-L Administrators: Peter Stokes, James Cummings
Infrastructure/Technical Support: Peter Stokes, Takako Kato

This is in addition to other volunteers who are not appointed directly by the Board but who still make important contributions; a list of many (but not all) of them is available at <http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/about/>. Indeed, I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has contributed to Digital Medievalist, but particularly the outgoing Board members, and above all our outgoing director, James Cummings, who has served on the Board since its inception and Directed very capably since 2009.

Finally, can I remind everyone that the Board is always looking for new initiatives and ideas. If you have ideas of what DM could or should do, or if you want to arrange something under the auspices of DM yourself, then please do get in touch, preferably by e-mailing the following:
_redacted_(a)digitalmedievalist.org (for general issues), or
_redacted_(a)digitalmedievalist.org (for the journal specifically)

We have a lot of skill and a lot of ideas as a community, and I look forward to working with you all to realise them.

Peter
