Call for Papers | 2022 Topic: [re]constructions

/magazén/ is accepting proposals to its 2022 volume entitled
[re]constructions, which shall devote two semestral issues of the
journal (June and December) to the theory and practice of
[re]configuring lost realities, [re]creating long gone dimensions,
[re]building likely scenarios, [re]considering exhibition settings and
[re]covering disappeared traces of historical and cultural value.
Indeed, over the last decade the principle of [re]construction by means
of scholarly expertise set the pace of many recent research projects in
the prosperous field of digital and public humanities. Particularly
digital tools and interdisciplinary collaborations provided the
opportunity to [re]compose varied sources and [re]visualise research
data, such as to offer unprecedented insights in historical, societal,
cultural, artistic, archaeological, and political events. Evolving
research technologies and consolidated methodological approaches in the
digital and public humanities allowed scholars to test their analytical
abilities against a set of novel possibilities to make their results
public, immersive, and virtually appreciated. In this regard, digital
and public humanities lay at the crossroads of the kind of speculation,
intuition, and invention that comes with every act of scholarly
[re]construction, seen as a creative task steered by scientific rigour.

A true symbol of this attitude are the square brackets, which stand as a
visual sign and signifier of the ‘gap-filling’ and ‘meaning-making’
tasks humanists always aim to accomplish in their research work. In a
sense, digital and public humanists have the privilege of [re]framing
their disciplines in various ways, such as: filling the gap of missing
text fragments and traditions, retracing the dynamics of historical
processes and events, retrieving dispersed artworks and collections,
reconstructing lost archaeological sites and artefacts. Eventually,
/magazén/’s volume 2022 will draw particular attention to the public
aspects of such endeavours, given that successful [re]constructions hold
firm to the principle of research dissemination and audience involvement
from their very inception, rather than having public access just as a
late side-effect of scholarly work.

Hence, for its 2022 volume /magazén/ is set to examine in two semestral
issues the concept of ‘[re]constructions’ as a procedural and
constitutional peculiarity of digital and public humanities. Scholars
are particularly invited to submit contributions that span from
theoretical debates to methodological reflections, also comprising the
examination of particular case studies from the heterogeneous domains of
Digital Textual Scholarship, Digital and Public History, Digital and
Public Archaeology, Digital and Public Art History, GLAM studies.

For scholars interested in submitting a proposal, please write an
abstract of no more than 200 words together with a short biographical
note and the provisional title of the paper. All materials should be
sent by September 15, 2021 via email (subject: “magazén 2022 – Call for
Papers”) to the editorial board at the following address:
_redacted_(a)unive.it>. Notice of selection will be
given to authors within four weeks from submission deadline.

Finalised contributions are expected to be 6,000-9,000 words long (notes
and bibliography included) and will undergo double blind peer review.
Accepted languages are Italian and English, though all texts must have
an English abstract and stick to the ‘Editorial Guidelines’
<https://edizionicafoscari.unive.it/media/pdf/pubblicare-con-noi/ecf_norme_en.pdf> of
Edizioni Ca’ Foscari. Texts that should not comply with editorial
guidelines will not be accepted. Please note that the author must secure
all copyright permissions (reproduction costs included) for images and
other media.

The deadline for all accepted articles is February 15, 2022, for issue 1
and July 15, 2022, for issue 2. Final publication of the first issue is
planned by June 2022, while the second issue will be due in December 2022.
