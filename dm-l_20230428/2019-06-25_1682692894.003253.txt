Subject: [dm-l] Methodologies for teaching History with Wikipedia (seminar)

Juliana Bastos Marques (Rio de Janeiro)
Methodologies for teaching Ancient History with Wikipedia

Friday June 28, 2019 at 16:30 in room G34
Institute of Classical Studies, Senate House, Malet Street, London WC1E 7HU

This activity will present and discuss some methodologies in different scenarios for teaching about the Ancient World through the use of Wikipedia, where the students learn content, writing and critical reading through editing articles. Several classroom models are possible, from a 2-hour lecture, a full-day workshop to an entire semester. We will approach the encyclopaedia’s “Five Pillars” (notability, impartiality, free content, civility in cooperation, and proactivity) and how they can help students to develop informational literacy through the study of Classics. We will also discuss Wikimedia Commons for working with media related to the written content.

Please bring along your laptops if you'd like to participate in live editing!

Seminar will be streamed and archived at: https://youtu.be/9ELFC90I2jI
