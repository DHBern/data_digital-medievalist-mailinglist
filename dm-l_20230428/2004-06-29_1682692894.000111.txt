Sure. TEI P5 is the name of the forthcoming revision of the TEI standard 
(currently version P4). Janus tags is a neat term for something that has 
been discussed as an addition to the standard. Its purpose is to address 
the problem raised (I think here) by Dot about markup in attribute values.

Here's an example. Currently in TEI (P4), you have the tags <sic> and 
<corr> for marking either the erroneous text (sic) or the corrected text 
(corr) in a document (e.g. this is <sic>an</sic> mistake; or this is 
<corr>a</corr> mistake). An obvious desideratum is that there be some 
mechanism for indicating what the 'opposite' form is (i.e. what the 
correct reading should be in the case of sic or what the original error 
was in the case of corr).

One method of doing currently this is using attributes: this is <sic 
corr="a">an</sic> mistake; or this is <corr sic="an">a</corr> mistake. 
The problem, however, comes if the text that is supposed to go on the 
attribute has markup itself. E.g.

this is <emph>an</emph> mistake.

When we come to indicate the error in this example, we have markup on an 
attribute value: 

this is <sic corr="<emph>a</emph>"><emph>an</emph></sic> mistake.

Janus tags are a way out of this problem. They are use to indicate that 
two options can be entertained at a certain point in the markup, but 
that only one would normally be chosen at any one time. So to return to 
our example, we might have something like this:

this is <janus><error>an</error><correct>a</correct></janus> mistake.

In this system, there is no problem with markup on attribute values. The 
version with <emph> would be encoded like this:

this is 
<janus><error><emph>an</emph></error><correct><emph>a</emph></correct></janus> 
mistake.

The system isn't foolproof, though that's a separate issue.
