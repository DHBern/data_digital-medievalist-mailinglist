Subject: Re: [dm-l] Re: Exeter Book CD: for free?

Has Bernard paid his own airfare to the U.K. to work on the Exeter 
project? I don't know him well enough to ask, but I'd say probably not, 
if his professional life is financed the way that of most professors is. 
Rather, he got a grant from an agency (public or non-profit) that is not 
asking to be reimbursed. Who paid for all that programming? Possibly the 
press, which will want its money back, but if the same programming is 
being used by OUP, which is selling Junius 11 at a fraction of the cost, 
I doubt it: If I were Exeter UP and I had paid for the programming, I'd 
be demanding a fee that would jack up the price of the Junius CD and 
lower my own price. No, I'll bet that the programming was paid for by 
Bernard's university or some granting agency--which, in that case, is 
not looking for its money back.

So what explains the difference in price? Sorry, not the amount of 
material: the books contain approximately the same number of folios 
(Exeter 123 folios; Junius 229 pp., or 115 folios). Perhaps the two 
presses are thinking very differently about prices and profits: Exeter 
remembering what Rosenkilde and Bagger used to charge for EEMF volumes 
and OUP thinking about the actual cost of producing the CD. Or maybe 
Exeter Cathedral is charging a high royalty while the Bod is charging a 
low one (but my experience of both libraries suggests that that is 
unlikely). Truly, I can't explain it.

As to the general point about free electronic resources vs. ones you pay 
for, I think there is room in the world for both. There are good reasons 
to charge for electronic resources; but I hope there will always be a 
place for free resources as well, and I am heartened that so much 
high-quality material is available on the web. For my own part, I'd like 
for any electronic resources I produce to be freely available.
