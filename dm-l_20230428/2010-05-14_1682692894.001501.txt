Subject: Re: [dm-l] Apologies

And in a perfect storm, I need to apologise as well: an opportunity in 
my wife's field work suddenly opened up so she needed to be in the field 
this week. I thought I had contacted everybody I was supposed to be 
dealing with in Kalamazoo, but see I missed this as well.

We should keep our head down in anticipation of the third piece of bad 
luck/news/behaviour.

Sorry again!
