Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities (Day of DH) is a community
publication project that will bring together digital humanists from around
the world to document what they do on one day, March 18th. The goal of the
project is to create a web site that weaves together the journals of the
participants into a picture that answers the question, 3Just what do
computing humanists really do?2 Participants will document their day through
photographs and commentary in a blog-like journal. The collection of these
journals with links, tags, and comments will make up the final work which
will be published online.On March 18th, participants will document and share the events of their day.
However participants will also become co-authors, and the direction of the
entire project will be influenced by their choices, both before and after
the day of documentation. Eventually, the data will be grouped together,
undergo some light semantic editing, and released for others to study. We
hope that, beyond the original online publication, the raw data will be of
use to those interested in further visualization or ethnographic
experiments.
A reminder to those who want to participate in the Day of Digital Humanities
2010 that we would appreciate you registering by the end of the 10th of
March. We will be creating the blogs on the 11th so you have time to
experiment.To find out about this project and to register go to:http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_
Humanities_2010This is not a project just for "important" digital humanists. We want a
diversity of perspectives including students, librarians, programmers and
those who feel what they do is modest!So please invite your students and colleagues.For those who like to lurk during such online events we will have an RSS
feed you can follow, as we did last year. There is also a twitter hashtag,
#dayofdh for those who want to have a parallel discussion.Yours,Geoffrey Rockwell
