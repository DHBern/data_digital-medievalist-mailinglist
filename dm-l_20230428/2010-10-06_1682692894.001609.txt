Subject: [dm-l] TAN: How does one reference a location in an electronic book

Hi all,

Good question from a student: if she is referencing a specific passage 
in a book on a Kindle that (apparently) has no pages or paragraph 
numbers, what does she do? She says Kindle has something called 
"locations" but it isn't clear to me if these are canonical or more like 
arbitrary bookmarks from how she is describing them (I don't have any 
ereaders, and so don't know).

Anybody know what you are supposed to do? I guess she could count 
paragraphs if it was that important, or, as with a very long webpage, 
just skip providing a location more precise than the entire work on the 
theory that you could full-text-search for it.
