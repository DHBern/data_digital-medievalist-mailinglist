Hello All,

At last year's Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Member's Meeting, I (along with Peter Robinson, and Patrick Durusau of the Society for Biblical Literature) convened a Special Interest Group on Overlapping Markup issues. We haven't done very much since then, unfortunately, but Patrick and I are slowly working on a web page that will highlight various different approaches to dealing with overlapping markup and conflicting hierarchies. I'll post an announcement here when the page goes live - it's good to see that folks are so interested in this problem!

There is also an overlapping markup listserv, to join go to http://listserv.brown.edu/tei-ol-sig.html. (Also, if you're interested in reading the report from last year's meeting, you can find it here: http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Activities/SIG/Overlap/olm01.txt)

Many thanks to Daniel et. al. for putting this listserv together!

Dot Porter
