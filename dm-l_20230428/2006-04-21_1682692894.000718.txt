Subject: Re: [dm-l] A proposal

Hey all, 

I'd like to point to us toward what someone in biblical studies has done: http://biblioblog.net/ 

The site is mostly oriented toward blogs, hence the name, (btw, not enough of you have good blogs out there.  Neither do I.) but if y ou scroll down the left menu you'll also note a "Lists/Discussions" heading that does post some messages from email lists in the field.  I note though that at least the ones for today are all from yahoo groups email lists rather than university based lists, so that might present a problem in setting up the system.  But since I have faith in medievalists and our use of technology I believe we could find a way to adapt this to Dan's proposal.
