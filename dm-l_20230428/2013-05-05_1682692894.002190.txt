Subject: [dm-l] DigiPal (Digital Resource and Database of Palaeography)

Dear all,

With great delight, the DigiPal team at the Department of Digital Humanities (King's College London) 
announce the launch of the new DigiPal website at http://digipal.eu 

For those of you who haven't been following our progress, DigiPal is a web-based resource for the 
delivery of palaeographical content. Although our test case is eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon vernacular 
script, the underlying DigiPal framework has been designed to work with multiple periods and languages,
and we already have Scandinavian and Hebrew projects using our tools, with the intention to extend the 
framework to further materials, including cuneiform.

At present, there are c. 300 high quality images available on our site and we've annotated over 12,000 
individual letters. 

Oh, and thanks to funding from the ERC (EU FP7), everything is available for free ;-)

To get you started, here are a couple of serving suggestions:

A) For f. 29v of Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 173, visit: http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/page/110/

   Things you might like to try:

   1) Turn annotations On/Off
   2) Click on a highlighted letter to see our description
   3) Click on "Filter annotations" to highlight a particular letter, or series of letters, that we have annotated
   4) Click on the "Annotations by allograph" tab. If you click on an allograph, it will take you back to the ms 
        context, with that letter highlighted
   5) Click on the "This record has 19 images" to see other folios from this ms.

NB: The metadata is very basic at the moment. Eventually, there will be all sorts of information, including 
        Ker, Scragg, Gneuss, Sawyer, etc. numbers. A summary of the content of the manuscript. Information 
        aggregated from other projects who have generously shared their data, e.g. 
       "English Manuscripts 1060 to 1220": http://www.le.ac.uk/english/em1060to1220/mss/EM.CCCC.173.htm

B) To see all the manuscripts from Cambridge, Corpus Christi College currently in the DigiPal database, visit:

    http://www.digipal.eu/digipal/page/?town_or_city=&repository=Corpus+Christi+College&date=

NB: Click on the "Images" button on the right to see thumbnail images.

With a big thank you to everyone who has helped us to get this far! There's c. 18 months of the project left 
and *much* more to come still. So, please get in touch with feedback and encouragement ;-)

Have fun, Stewart
