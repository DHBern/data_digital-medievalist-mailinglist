*Graecum-Arabicum-Latinum Encoded Corpus (GALENÂ©)*
Usama Gad (Heidelberg)

GALEN is a long-term project to produce the first comprehensive digital 
corpus of translations between Greek, Arabic and Latin. The project 
seeks not only to include the medieval translations from Greek into 
Arabic (8th-10th Century AD) and again from Arabic into Latin (11th 
-13th Century AD), but also to comprise the modern translations of Greek 
and Latin literature into Arabic (19th -21st Century AD). Moreover, the 
project would ideally include Arabic translations of Greek and Latin 
Papyri found in Egypt. The main idea behind this project is then to 
integrate as much Graecum-Arabicum-Latinum sources as one could in both 
Arabic and classical studies, presenting these sources to both scholars 
and students in a digital format with open access license CC BY-SA.

ALL WELCOME

The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.
