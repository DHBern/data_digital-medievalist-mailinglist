Dear Medievalists,

We are delighted to announce that the Digital Scholarly Editions  
Initial Training Network (DiXiT) has been awarded a multi-million Euro  
European grant for investigating the creation and publication of  
digital scholarly editions.

DiXiT is an international network of high-profile institutions from  
the public and the private sector offering a coordinated training and  
research programme for early stage researchers and experienced  
researchers in the multi-disciplinary skills, technologies, theories,  
and methods of digital scholarly editing.

The programme includes twelve fellowships for early stage researchers  
(PhD students) for a period of three years, and five fellowships for  
experienced researchers (Post-Docs) for a period of 12 to 20 months.  
The positions will be widely advertised starting from the month of  
October.

DiXiT will also organise six training events at various levels (camps  
& conventions), open to all DiXiT fellows as well as to other people  
that may be interested in the topics covered.

The DiXiT network includes the following academic partners:
