I can confirm that the AHDS primers are certainly not up to date, and the AHDS
is working on this and also plans to produce "Information Sheets" on particular, 
more specific topics which will be more easily updated in the future.  (The 
Oxford Text Archive hosts the Arts and Humanities Data Service (AHDS) centre 
for Literature, Language and Linguistics...so we are meant to be writing some 
of them.)
