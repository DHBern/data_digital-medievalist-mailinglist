Dear all,

Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) to be held in Venice on November 7th

which was about the Error Correction of HTR output for Greek papyri and
Byzantine manuscripts. The second day will be dedicated to "Error
Correcting HTR for Historical Sources" in general.

The conference is organised by the VeDPH/DSU in collaboration with
Stockholm University, Sweden. Attendance is open for everyone and free
