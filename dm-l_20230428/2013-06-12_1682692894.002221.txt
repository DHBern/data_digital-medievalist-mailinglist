Subject: Re: [dm-l] Mailing List, Wiki, Blog or what?My personal favourites are web forums (they offer threading, usable
archives, search interfaces, RSS-feeds, the option to give different
"rights" to different people, direct messaging, ... ).I haven't subscribed to a mailing list for ages, and I'm reading
most of the mailing lists I'm subscribed to only about once a week.These days I get most interaction on G+ (which does have
"communities"), but that may be due more to the people interacting
than to G+.    BestHeinrich
