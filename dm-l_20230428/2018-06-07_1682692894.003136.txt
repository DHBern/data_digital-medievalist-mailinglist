Subject: [dm-l] Open call: Modeling Travels in History: an ORBIS-esque

_redacted_@ Uni 
Vienna (July 18-20, 2018)

Everyone is familiar with Google Maps—all of us are using it on a daily 
basis. In 2012 a group of researchers at Stanford (led by Walter 
Scheidel), developed Orbis (http://orbis.stanford.edu/)[1], which, one 
may put, applied the same geographical principles to a particular 
historical context. Dubbed “a Google Maps for the Roman Empire”[2], this 
model became a popular historical online resource and an object of envy 
for scholars working in other historical contexts.

Inspired by Orbis, the Uni-Wien DH Team is organizing a three-day 
hackathon at the University of Vienna on the theme of map visualisations 
for historical data. One specific objective of the hackathon will be to 
build a sort of “Orbis-in-a-Box”—an open-source platform that would 
allow others to model movements of people and objects in different 
historical and cultural contexts. (For more details on this particular 
idea, see: http://kgeographer.com/orbis-in-a-box/).

We are inviting interested digital humanists with an inclination for 
coding to partake in this 3-day event in Vienna. We are able to offer 
small bursaries to offset traveling costs.

If you would like to attend, please send a message to 
_redacted_(a)univie.ac.at with “ORBIS-esque Hackathon” in the subject 
by 30 June 2018, stating your current institutional affiliation (if any) 
and your motivation for participating in the hackathon. Please also 
specify whether you are applying for a bursary.

Yours truly,
Uni-Wien DH Team
