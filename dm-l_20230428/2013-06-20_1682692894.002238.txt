Subject: [dm-l] Final Call: Global Digital Humanities Essay Competition

**** Please Cross Post ****

Hi all,

Global Outlook :: Digital Humanities, The University of Lethbridge, and 
The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations is pleased to announce 
the first Global Digital Humanities Essay Competition. 
http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/global-outlookdigital-humanities-global-digital-humanities-essay-prize/

This is an open competition for research papers on the national, 
regional, or international practice of the Digital Humanities--a broad 
topic that has been designed to give authors the greatest possible 
scope. Authors may write on individual projects or problems or broader 
philosophical, geographical, sociological, political, or other aspects 
of the practice of Digital Humanities in a global context. Papers 
discussing the practice of DH by or with marginalised communities or in 
areas that are currently less well represented by ADHO are particularly 
welcome.

The competition is open to any interested party including students, 
graduate students, junior faculty, and researchers unaffiliated with a 
university or research institution. We would like to especially 
encourage submissions from students, junior and unaffiliated 
researchers, and authors belonging to marginalised communities or 
communities currently less well represented by ADHO.

The competition is offering a minimum of 4 prizes of $500 (CAD) each. 
Initial selection (for a prize of $200) is by abstract/proposal. A 
further $300 will be awarded to the authors of the winning abstracts 
upon satisfactory completion of a full-length paper based on their 
original proposal. All submissions will be eligible for review and 
publication in the ADHO journal, Digital Studies/Le champ num√©rique 
(http://digitalstudies.org/).

For further information about the competition, please see the 
competition web page:

The competition organisers can also be contacted by email at
