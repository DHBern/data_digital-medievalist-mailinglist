I know a number of people who use moodle and like it.  It is an online
courseware CMS so has features for the overall design of sites, enrolment of
students, etc. but also course-level modules for: assignments, chatting, voting,
forums, glossaries, lessons, quizzes, resource delivery, surveys, wikis,
workshops, etc. etc.

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Features.

Moreover, those of you using ubuntu or debian linux who have TEI package
repository in your sources list (see http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/teideb/ ) can just
'sudo apt-get install moodle' to get it installed and set up.

Best,
-James
