Subject: Re: [dm-l] DM Election Results

Dear all,

On behalf of the Board, I want to send congratulations and welcome to Suzanne and Ben who are now joining us. Very many thanks also to Malte Rehbein and Torsten Schassan who have both stepped down this year. Both Torsten and Malte have contributed a great deal to DM over a number of years, and so we will miss them and hope very much that they will continue to be actively involved.

Thanks also to the other candidates for running – we hope very much that you will stay involved – and thanks finally to Orietta and Takako for all their work managing the elections.

I was personally very happy to see such a strong set of candidates this year, and indeed the last few years. The number of members is growing rapidly as well, and so I look forward very much to what the future will bring to DM.

Best wishes,

Peter Stokes

Director, Digital Medievalist
