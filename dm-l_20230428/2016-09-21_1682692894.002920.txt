Dear all,

Models of Authority and DigiPal are organising two digital methods sessions at Leeds 2017 

Session 1: "Digital Methods 1: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Palaeography"

Session 2: "Digital Methods 2: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Manuscript Studies"

Interested? Then send us an abstract! It's all pretty simple really. All you need to do is read the blurbs 
below; decide which session suits you best; and then send an abstract of a couple of hundred words or so 
_redacted_(a)kcl.ac.uk by 28th September 2016.

Looking forward to reading your abstracts,

"Digital Methods 1: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Palaeography"

Taking palaeography and codicology as its focus, this session will consider how computer-assisted techniques 
might advance our understanding of the handwriting of medieval scribes.

"Digital Methods 2: Computer-Assisted Approaches to Manuscript Studies"

The large number of initiatives to digitise medieval manuscripts mean that we now have unprecedented access 
to medieval texts. In many ways, this explosion of knowledge can be compared to the early years of the printing 
press. But how might we best utilise this growing body of material? This session will explore the potential for the 
computer-assisted study of medieval manuscripts; discuss the intersection of manuscript studies and Digital Humanities; 
and share methodologies. The topics under discussion will include the encoding and transcription of medieval texts, the 
practical and theoretical consequences of the use of digital surrogates and the visualisation of manuscript evidence and 
data.
