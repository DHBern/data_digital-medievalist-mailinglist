Subject: [dm-l] DM News Server Kudos

James is really to be congratulated for fixing up the DM newserver, 
replacing the buggy, handrolled one I did as an exercise in learning PHP.

As James mentions in the email, this new server allows posters to a) 
push their messages to the list; b) have a record that will be indexed 
by the search engines, and c) allow distribution to people who subscribe 
to the server, even if they are not members of the list--all this using 
a single form.

Although the server is powered by wordpress, you can access it from the 
digitalmedievalist.org site, by clicking on the news tab. Every posting 
to dm-l also contains a link to the server in the information found at 
the bottom of the page.

Thanks again, James!
