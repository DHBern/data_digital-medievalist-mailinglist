Subject: [dm-l] Cocoon authentication--anybody with experience?

Hi all,

Here's a question I'm hoping somebody knows an answer to. I've 
experimenting with cocoon, which of course is excellent at doing things 
like remapping xml files so that users think they are reading a file in 
html, and the like. The Digital Medievalist site is in fact produced 
using cocoon which transforms the underlying xml.

What I need to be able to do is use passwords to protect this site. I've 
read up on cocoon's authentication model, including the sample code. But 
they don't give examples with kind of authentication backend I'm most 
familiar with .htpasswd (or any at all, really).

Does anybody have experience with cocoon's authentication, particularly 
using an easy-to-set-up authentication backend (and even better 
.htpasswd)? I appreciate any suggestions, especially since, as this 
project is in pre-funding mode, I'll have to learn any system proposed 
rather than having the money to hire somebody who knows what they are doing.
