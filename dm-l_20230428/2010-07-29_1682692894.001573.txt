I did think about biblStruct, but I'm not aware of any widely used reference managers that have it as their primary import format. It's easy enough to do and can't hurt, but it does raise the question of where to stop.

As well as automatic adding to Zotero, I think it would also be useful to add a manual 'Download to citation manager' option, but I wonder what formats people want. Certainly Bibtex, Endnote, perhaps Delicious. Procite? Reference Manager? What else are we using these days?

I assume you need some kind of metadata in the site header? Perhaps you all could look into adding this? Preferably for the individual articles, as well as the full issues.
