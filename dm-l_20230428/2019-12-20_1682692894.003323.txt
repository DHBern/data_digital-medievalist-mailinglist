Subject: [dm-l] EVT 1.3 released

Dear all,
after a long wait, EVT version 1.3 is finally available! The full 
announcement for this release is available on the EVT blog: 
https://visualizationtechnology.wordpress.com/2019/12/20/evt-1-version-1-3-released/. 
You can quickly download the archive here: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/evt-project/files/evt-v1.3.zip/download 
(and the manual here: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/evt-project/files/EVT%20Manual_v1.3.pdf/download), 
but you can also browse the sample editions directly on the project home 
page.

Besides new features and bug fixes, we moved the repository to GitHub 
(https://github.com/evt-project/evt-builder) to make it more accessible: 
this is going to be the last version of the 1.* series, from now on, all 
development efforts will focus on EVT 2 to reach feature parity with EVT 
1 (with regard to diplomatic editions) and to improve / develop new 
features, starting from support for critical editions.

In any case, EVT 1.3 is a mature, featureful product which can be used 
"as is" for diplomatic / single witness editions, or can be further 
customized by anyone who has good knowledge of XSLT 2 and HTML/CSS.

So enjoy the goodies, but also have a look at EVT 2 
(https://github.com/evt-project/evt-viewer) because that's where all 
future development is going to have place!
