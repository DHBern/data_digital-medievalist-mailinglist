Subject: [dm-l] PhD students in Digital Humanities at Passau

Dear list,

In addition to the recently advertised PostDoc, I am searching for two
PhD students to join the Digital Humanities team at Passau as research
and teaching fellows.

Find more details in the job description:
http://www.uni-passau.de/fileadmin/dokumente/beschaeftigte/Stellenangebote/2013_04_WM_Prof_Rehbein_Doktoranden_engl_1_1.pdf

International candidates are welcome to apply in English, and German is
not a requirement for your research and teaching.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with
me. The deadline for applications is May 27th.

Best regards,
Malte
