Subject: [dm-l] Final call for applications: NEH Summer Institute for advanced

Dear colleagues,

** With the usual apologies for cross-posting **

The call for applications for the NEH Institute "Advanced Digital Editing" is almost closing: applications are due Februari 28th, 2020.

The target audience for this two-week workshop is textual scholars who are already comfortable editing their digital texts in TEI XML or comparable alternatives; the goal of the Institute is to assist them in moving beyond textual editing to imagining, creating, and publishing research-driven, theoretically and methodologically innovative digital editions.

For the full call, see <https://pittsburgh-neh-institute.github.io/Institute-Materials-2020/call/>

Feel free to circulate this message widely.

Best wishes,
Elli
