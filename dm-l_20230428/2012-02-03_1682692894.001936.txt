Subject: Re: [dm-l] A new typeface that might be of interest to medievalists,

I saw this mentioned on another list and have had a quick look. It looks 
very good. But I'd question whether Brill has "opened access." It's 
offered for private use only: the website doesn't say, but I suspect 
that if you want to use it in a publication you'll have to pay. There 
are several very good fonts for medievalists (besides Junicode, which I 
keep going on about); you can find them listed at the Medieval Unicode 
Font Initiative website (http://mufi.info). I'll also mention, for 
people who have a budget to spend on a font, Andron Mega 
(http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=145). The design 
is brilliant, and it covers everything medievalists want.
