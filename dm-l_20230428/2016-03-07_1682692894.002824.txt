Subject: [dm-l] EVT version 1.0 has been released

Dear all,
after a couple of intermediate releases, EVT version 1.0 is finally 
available! There are many new features in this version: support for 
single document information to be showed in the text frame, a full text 
search engine, support for named entities (name highlighting in the 
edition text, browsable full lists with links to single documents), User 
Interface localization, and more!

_redacted_(a)gmail.com, we would love to 
hear from you: bug reports, suggestions, even your general impressions 
about how EVT has worked for you are more than welcome.
