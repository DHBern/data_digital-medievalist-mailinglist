Subject: [dm-l] Three jobs at King's College London (CCH)

Job posting: three Project Research Associates required

[With apologies for cross-posting]

The Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's College London is looking for three highly motivated and technically sophisticated individuals to work on its text-based research projects. The positions will involve using computer tools and methods to facilitate digital scholarship.

CCH is both a department with responsibility for its own academic programme and a research centre promoting the appropriate application of computing in humanities research. Its research projects cover a wide range of humanities disciplines, including medieval studies, history, literature and linguistics, and music, and also include a number of more general information management projects in both humanities and the social sciences.

The successful candidates will possess strong analytical and problem solving skills: they will be required to identify and engage with the core scholarly questions in a highly collaborative research context; to analyse a wide variety of humanities materials and to model them using XML-related technologies; to design and develop systems for editing and delivering text-based scholarly materials and to collaborate in the design of integrated HTML-based publication. Experience in creating and manipulating XML documents in a range of XML-related standards and technologies (DTDs, XPath, XSLT) is highly desirable, in particular textual materials encoded according to the Text Encoding Initiative's guidelines.

All successful candidates will need to have a good understanding of how research is conducted in the humanities and social sciences and will be expected to make a strong contribution to the departmental research profile. They will need to be able to work effectively as part of a team, as well as independently. They must have good communication skills and the ability to document their work in clear written English.

One position is for one year on Fixed Term Contract (Maternity Cover) - within the Grade 5 scale, currently £28,074 to £32,176, inclusive of London Allowance.

Two positions are for one year on Fixed Term Contract - within the Grade 6 scale, currently £30,070 to £39,038 per annum, inclusive of London Allowance.

Closing date: 12th February 2010
