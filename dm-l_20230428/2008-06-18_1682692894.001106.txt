‘The Son of Suda On Line: a next generation collaborative editing tool’

ALL WELCOME

I shall discuss the Son of Suda On Line (SoSOL), a proposed web-based, fully audited, version-controlled editing environment being built for the papyrological community but designed for applicability to other editing communities. It will enable the collaborative editing of texts in a framework of rigorous and transparent peer-review and credit mechanisms and strong editorial oversight.

The seminar will be followed by wine and refreshments.
