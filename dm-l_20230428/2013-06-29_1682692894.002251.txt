Subject: [dm-l] Global Digital Humanities Essay Competition: Deadline Extended

The Global Outlook::Digital Humanities Essay Contest Deadline has been 
extended until Noon GMT July 6, 2013. A description of the competition 
can be found below and at the GO::DH website: 
http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/global-outlookdigital-humanities-global-digital-humanities-essay-prize/

The deadline is being extended in recognition of the diverse nature of 
the target audience and to ensure that nobody is prevented from 
contributing due to infrastructure problems or late notice of the 
competition.

Participants who have already made a submission but feel that they could 
profit from the extension are welcome to resubmit their work by the 
extended deadline, otherwise the original submission will be entered in 
the competition. In the case of multiple submissions from the same 
author, the committee will use the latest submission unless otherwise 
instructed.

The adjudication would like to thank the many participants who have 
already made submissions to the competition. We are very much looking 
forward to reading your work!

P.S. We apparently forgot to list Word as an acceptable format for 
submission. This was an oversight on our part. The committee can 
consider files in Word format.

Contest description

Global Outlook :: Digital Humanities, The University of Lethbridge, 
Digital Studies/Le champ numérique, and The Alliance of Digital 
Humanities Organisations is pleased to announce the first Global Digital 
Humanities Essay Competition. 
http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/global-outlookdigital-humanities-global-digital-humanities-essay-prize/

This is an open competition for research papers on the national, 
regional, or international practice of the Digital Humanities--a broad 
topic that has been designed to give authors the greatest possible 
scope. Authors may write on individual projects or problems or broader 
philosophical, geographical, sociological, political, or other aspects 
of the practice of Digital Humanities in a global context. Papers 
discussing the practice of DH by or with marginalised communities or in 
areas that are currently less well represented by ADHO are particularly 
welcome.

The competition is open to any interested party including students, 
graduate students, junior faculty, and researchers unaffiliated with a 
university or research institution. We would like to especially 
encourage submissions from students, junior and unaffiliated 
researchers, and authors belonging to marginalised communities or 
communities currently less well represented by ADHO.

The competition is offering a minimum of 4 prizes of $500 (CAD) each. 
Initial selection (for a prize of $200) is by abstract/proposal. A 
further $300 will be awarded to the authors of the winning abstracts 
upon satisfactory completion of a full-length paper based on their 
original proposal. All submissions will be eligible for review and 
publication in the ADHO journal, Digital Studies/Le champ numérique 
(http://digitalstudies.org/).

For further information about the competition, please see the 
competition web page:
