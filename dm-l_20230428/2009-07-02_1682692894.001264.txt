Subject: [dm-l] Anybody know of a html --> mediawiki parser/script?

Hi all,

Anybody know of a script or parser that could convert HTML files INTO 
mediawiki markup? We have a whole bunch of rescued wiki pages from 
archive.org, but they are only the HTML display version. Cutting and 
pasting the html into the mediawiki edit window isn't working as cleanly 
as I thought it might, so I'm looking for something that would strip out 
markup mediawiki doesn't accept.
