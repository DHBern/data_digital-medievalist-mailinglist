[Apologies for cross-posting]

The Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH) is seeking to appoint three creative, enthusiastic professionals to develop web-based applications bringing together materials from existing database-and XML-based resources. You would be working closely with colleagues in CCH and in humanities and social science departments.

CCH is an academic department in the School of Humanities. It is responsible for undergraduate and MA programmes and runs a PhD. As part of its very active research programme, the Centre is involved in a large number of externally funded collaborative research projects. These posts are intended to support the technical development of a number of these projects.

Details about the posts are provided below:

[Post 1] TECHNICAL PROJECT OFFICER (Web Application Development). G6/AAV/019/08

Experience in design and in building environments based on database technologies is essential. The department uses primarily Java and J2EE technologies to publish database materials on the web, and knowledge of these technologies is also critical. Web interfaces are developed with the use of well established JavaScript/AJAX frameworks and in accordance with good XHTML and CSS practices, and experience with these are highly desirable. Familiarity with XML and XSLT is desirable.

Proven experience in creating integrated research applications using a range of technologies would be a significant advantage. In addition, a good understanding - and preferably experience - of how research is conducted in the humanities and social sciences will be valuable.
