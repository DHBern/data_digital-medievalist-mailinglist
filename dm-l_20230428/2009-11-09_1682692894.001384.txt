Subject: [dm-l] Job announcement: Virtual Research Enviroment on Averroes,

Hello all,

the Thomas Institute at the University of Cologne (Germany) is looking for 
two or more research associates in a newly funded project "Digital Averroes 
Research Environment" (DARE). In general there is one position for the 
"technical" side and one position for "medieval philosophy", but we are 
free to shape these positions as fits best to the setup of possible 
candidates. Please see the complete announcement at 
http://www.dare.uni-koeln.de/stellen/index.php and note that German 
language skills (beyond understanding the job advertisement) are not a 
precondition.

Best, Patrick
