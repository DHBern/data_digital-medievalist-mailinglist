Dear Colleagues, 

We are currently seeking people who are willing to work with us as user testers as we develop our new web service, Manuscripts Online. You will be able to do the testing remotely, at four points during the next 12 months, and your responses will be recorded via an online survey. Working with us will enable you to have direct input into how Manuscript Online evolves. We are particularly interested in obtaining input from anyone who teaches, studies or undertakes research into any aspect of medieval English language, literature and history.

If you are interested in acting as one of our testers, please email hri-suppo_redacted_(a)shef.ac.uk and we will add you to our mailing list.
For more information see the project's blog:

Best wishes and thanks,
