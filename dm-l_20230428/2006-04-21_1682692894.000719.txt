I believe this is because the yahoo groups messages are available as RSS feeds,
so aggregating them is no different from aggregating bits of blogs or any other
RSS/atom feed.

I read a whole bunch of blogs and news feeds (using google reader in my case
http://www.google.com/reader) regularly, and would be happy to know of any more
related to humanities computing and digital medievalism if people have suggestions.

I would echo Paul's dislike of digested messages.  If I want to read the other
mailing lists then I'll subscribe to them.

However, I have no objection to DM-L being a subscriber to a few very
low-traffic and related announcement lists, like the junicode-announce one, but
only where it is something specific to DM's mission.  (I.e. although many of us
may also use linux, subscribing DM-L to a particular linux distribution's
announcement list would be silly.)  Other than the junicode one can people think
of announcement-type lists which are relevant to digital medievalists in specific?
