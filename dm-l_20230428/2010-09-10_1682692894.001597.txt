Subject: [dm-l] Marco MSS Workshop--deadline Oct. 1

Dear dm-l:

Though the CFP has been posted here before, I thought perhaps a reminder is in order: The deadline for proposals for the Marco Manuscripts Workshop on "Editions and E-ditions: New Media and Old Texts" is coming up Oct. 1. See the original dm-l posting for all the details:
