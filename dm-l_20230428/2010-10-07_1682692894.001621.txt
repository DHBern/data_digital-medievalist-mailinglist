Subject: Re: [dm-l] TAN: How does one reference a location in an electronic

IMO, the chief issue (although not the original question that launched the thread) is not whether it is possible to cite something with no pagination (or no date) -- because, yes, it always has been possible -- but whether there is a more useful way to cite current electronic publications that have some sort or another of "location" information already in them, as well as what would be useful ways to design (leaving aside the technical implementation considerations) the marking locations and/or sections in the contents in electronic publications without fixed pagination (because it is most useful to be able to use citation information to actually locate the contents to which the author intended to refer).

Cheers,
Carl
