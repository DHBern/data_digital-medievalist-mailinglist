Subject: Re: [dm-l] Has anybody used the new Ubuntu One Cloud service?

That's a good idea. Currently I rsync files around machines in my own 
little cloud, so I'm not 100% sure I need it for much. Sharing files is 
a good idea for it too, I suppose, though I don't lack server space of 
my own. It's one of those things that I'm sure should be really useful 
if only I could think of a use for it.
