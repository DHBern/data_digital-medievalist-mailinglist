Subject: [dm-l] Call for Papers: Digital Medievalist Journal

Call for Papers [Please Cross-Post]

The Digital Medievalist (DM) is a new on-line and refereed journal 
intended for medievalists working with digital media. The first issue is 
scheduled for publication this fall, with subsequent issues in Spring 
2005 and Summer 2005. The journal is edited by the executive of the 
_redacted_(a)uleth.ca> mailing list: 
Peter Baker, Martin Foys, Murray McGillivray, Kenna Olsen, Daniel Paul 
O'Donnell, Roberto Rosselli del Turco, and Elizabeth Solopova. Our 
second issue will include a selection of papers on technological topics 
from Medieval Conferences in Kalamazoo and Leeds 2004 as well as other 
articles.

DM accepts work of original research and scholarship, notes on
technological topics, commentary pieces discussing developments in the
field, bibliographic and review articles, and project reports describing
beginning, on-going, or completed projects. Contributors may also
describe tools and utilities they have developed, stylesheets,
markup-methods, imaging techniques, project management methods, etc.
Future editions will also contain reviews of publications, web-sites and
digital projects. All contributions are refereed by authorities in 
humanities computing.

Contributions to DM should concern topics likely to be of interest to
medievalists working with digital media, though they need not be
exclusively medieval in focus. Contributions should be of an appropriate
length to the subject under discussion. We anticipate most will be
between 1000 and 10,000 words. Our preferred format is TEI-Lite xml. If
you would like to discuss alternative submission formats, please contact
the editorial board.

Submissions received by September 30, 2004 will be eligible for 
consideration for publication in the inaugural (Fall 2004) issue. 
Contributions received after that date may be considered for subsequent 
issues.
