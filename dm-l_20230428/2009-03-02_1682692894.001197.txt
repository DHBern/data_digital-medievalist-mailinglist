Subject: Re: [dm-l] Ideal informatics training [TAN, maybe]

I'd like to thank contributors for the information on programmes and 
standards they've passed on. This is going to be very helpful. And I 
appreciate any others: I'll be putting together suggestions for the 
committee next weekend.

I found this "driver's licence" interesting, as indeed Lou's comments 
about the change coming with the arrival of more digital natives. I have 
been deeply impressed in the last year or two at the on-going changes in 
how our students work with computers. I think we really are just now 
getting first years who really can't imagine what it was like without 
the net, computers, and social networking. Even our fourth year students 
seem less native in their interactions.

The range between basic desktop apps and dbms is what we are trying to 
negotiate here. I'm thinking the answer might be to have a "driver's 
licence" type course as something that many students who are not 
interested in adding an informatics component to their degrees might 
find useful. And I am still amazed at how shallow some of the student's 
knowledge of basic office software really is.

But for the larger programme in informatics, it is exactly the issues 
Lou mentions at the end that are the skills we're considering:

> knowing about the hardware? programming? project management? systems 
> analysis and database design
The goal is that in a programme of eight or nine semester-long, North 
American style 3-credit courses, our students would graduate with an 
understanding of how ICT can be applied to research questions in their 
home domain, have some experience analysing information flow, in project 
management, HCI, and various other topics that would leave them equipped 
not so much to become ICT technicians or experts, but domain experts who 
would know enough about ICT to allow them to apply it intelligently and 
work with ICT technical experts in solving problems and designing solutions.

I'm hoping that we might find a variety of different paths in this area: 
one aimed at producing students with the type of skills we associate 
with programme at CCH or the University of Alberta (to name two) on the 
one hand, but that can also accommodate students with interest in other 
aspects of informatics or who only want to brush up immediately 
necessary skills.

Apart from perhaps a remedial course on standalone software, I think 
we'd be aiming primarily at covering networked technologies. And re 
Word--I'm also wondering if we could responsibly take an ideologically 
open source position without it becoming "tenured radicals" pushing 
their hobby horses.
