Subject: Re: [dm-l] Cocoon authentication--anybody with experience?

Hi James,

Yes indeed, I've been following that. Unless I'm nuts though, cocoon's 
framework is a framework that passes the authentication work itself 
(i.e. the password checking) to an external application, be that LDAP, 
or whatever. The examples are all very general.

I'll go through it to double check that I've not misread something when 
I get back from camping. But as far as I'm aware it passes something off 
in very much the way Hugh suggested he'd build it if it didn't exist.
