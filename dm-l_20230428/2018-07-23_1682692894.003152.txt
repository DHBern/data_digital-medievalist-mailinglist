*Backoff Lemmatization for Ancient Greek with the Classical Language Toolkit

Automated lemmatization, or retrieval of dictionary headwords, is an active area of research in historical-language text analysis. In this talk, I describe the development of the Backoff Lemmatizer for Ancient Greek with the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK), an open-source Python platform dedicated to developing natural language processing tools for historical languages. The Backoff Lemmatizer seeks to improve on existing tools by combining training-data-based and rules-based tagging as a lemmatization strategy. By way of conclusion, I discuss a current CLTK development strategy, namely the use of object-oriented architecture as an avenue to digital comparative philology.
