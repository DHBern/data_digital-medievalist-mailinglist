Subject: [dm-l] Senior Researcher Position on Digital Prosopography

Dear Digital Medievalists,

the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH-OeAW), a research 
department of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (Austria’s leading 
non-university research facility), is offering a

Senior Researcher Position (F/M/O) (full time, 40h/week)

prosopographical research. Digital prosopography ranges from classical 
ancient history to modern collective biography, from information 
extraction in modern news texts to visualisations of complex 
prosopographical data sets. A particular focus of the work in digital 
prosopography at ACDH-OeAW lies in contributing to the reusable tool set.

The successful candidate will be expected to initiate independent 
research projects and apply for external funding where feasible; to 
advise colleagues both within and outside the ACDH-OeAW about available
prosopographical tools and resources, and to present his or her work

salary of €42.551,60 (= grade IV/2 according to the collective agreement 
of the Austrian Academy of Sciences).
