I think it is a rule somewhere. If they'd chosen the day before or after it would turn out that you needed to move your grocery day just that week.

I'll be driving between New Haven and New York that day, I think.

Oh, good ! that's the day I do the weekly grocery shopping.

Then I guess I 'll come home and think about the Middle Ages for a 
while, before turning on Olbermann and Maddow.
