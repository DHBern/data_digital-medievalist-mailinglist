Subject: Re: [dm-l] Help with embedded images

Dear Prof. O'Donnell,

This doesn't directly address your problem, but should get you around
it entirely: using the <video> tag, it's now possible to embed video
in a page without using the QuickTime plug-in. There's an excellent
discussion of this at <http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html>. There are
also pre-made video players using this technique at
<http://videojs.com/>, <http://mediaelementjs.com/>, and
<http://www.jplayer.org/>. In addition to having a working video
player, your video should be more compatible with future browsers, and
will also work on mobile devices.

Hope that helps,

Googling around I discovered that the recommended way of doing this is to make a 1 frame movie saying something like "click on me" which you put on the src attribute, and then you add an href attribute with the name of the "real" movie. If you add target="_self" it is supposed to replace the place holder with the longer movie. This would be the code:

Since this is a very common thing on the internet, I must be doing something stupid. Does anybody know how to do it?
