Subject: [dm-l] Recommendations for Field Laser Scanning Providers?

Hi all,

For a grant application, I need to submit quotes on field laser 
scanning. We need to scan the Bewcastle, Ruthwell, and perhaps Brussels 
crosses to a very high degree of detail. Ruthwell is in a church, 
Bewcastle exposed in a field, and Brussels in a cathedral treasury. 
Ruthwell and Bewcastle are stone and around 15 feet tall; Brussels is 
partially gilt, and a couple of feet tall at most.

In the past we've used Archaeoptics, but my understanding is that they 
are now defunct. We also have had quotes from the CNS in Pisa. Does 
anybody have other recommendations? Obviously vendors in the U.K. would 
be obvious choices, but our experience is that the travel costs are not 
the largest part of the expense and that vendors on the continent can 
compete with British vendors quite well.

I greatly appreciate any suggestions!
