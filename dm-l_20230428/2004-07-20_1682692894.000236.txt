The easiest way is to go to:
http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/ and using the left-hand menu 
browse by language.  Sadly, trying to ignore that we 
have one of these catalogued as "Anglo-Saxon", and another 
catalogued as "English, Old".  The form is available from 
any of the links saying 'request text'.  (If it says 'get 
text' you can download it immediately.)  It is, again 
unfortunately, still a form one must print out, sign, and 
post/fax in.   If you detect in any of this an undertone 
that I'm unhappy with our current website, you'd be right!
We are in the process of overhauling the whole OTA workflow 
and both internal and external websites to all work together.  
So one day this will all hopefully be a lot easier and use 
open standards throughout.
