We meet this frequently when our keyers have neglected to capture
line numbers, and our best solution, though not ideal, is interactive
editing with an editor that allows not only automatic numbering, but
easy selection of lines to operate on, easy undo if it goes wrong,
and easy numbering from arbitrary starting points and with arbitrary
increments, e.g. 'replace every <l> in the selected region with
<l n="..."> starting at 238 and incrementing by 2 each time.'
TextPad (on Windows) does this well (replace <l> with <l n="\i(238,2)">)

If you have some match point in the 'external reference system'
on which to key in inserting numbers, a more elaborate scripted
solution suggests itself. But you probably don't.
