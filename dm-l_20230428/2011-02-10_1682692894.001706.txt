Subject: [dm-l] Data management best practices for advanced imaging(apologies for cross-posting - I sent this to DC as well)Hello Digital Medievalists,Here's a question for those of you involved in advanced imaging
projects (3D modeling, multi-spectral imaging, etc.). I'm looking for
best practices for managing this kind of data, specifically for
long-term preservation. Something parallel to what I might find for
(for example) storing digital images or encoded text files in a Fedora
repository.I hope this question makes sense. Answer me onlist or feel free to
contact me offlist.Thanks!
