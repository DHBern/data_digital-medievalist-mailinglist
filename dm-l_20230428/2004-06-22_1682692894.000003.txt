Subject: [dm-l] Experience using Microsoft's XSLT? and Is there a good acronym

Does anybody have experience using the recent releases of MSXML? I'm 
wondering in particular if their xslt is standards compliant. I 
understand from the XML bible 
<http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/books/bible2/chapters/ch17.html> that it is 
or was not. Microsoft's own pages make it sound like the latest versions 
might be 
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/xmlsdk/html/xmmscXMLOverview.asp>, 
but it can be difficult to trust them sometimes.

I ask because a neat tool (Textpipe 
<http://www.crystalsoftware.com.au/textpipe.html>) I use has now 
built-in XSLT, but depends on MSXML.

For those who don't know what I am talking about: XSLT (eXtensible 
Stylesheet Language-Tranformations) is a stylesheet language used 
(amongst other things) for converting documents written in XML 
(eXtensible Markup Language) such as used by the TEI (Text Encoding 
Initiative) into HTML for display on the web.

Once the web site is up, we should put all these acronyms into a FAQ 
(Frequently Asked Questions) file. Does anybody know of a good existing 
list of acronyms for beginners?
