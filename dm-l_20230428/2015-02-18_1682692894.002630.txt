Subject: Re: [dm-l] comparisons of different e-MS readers?

Just to add some sites with manuscript readers:

http://www.manuscriptorium.com/ (the reader unfortunately is closed source)

http://www.e-codices.ch/ (which has a very active development, some 
details can be found at http://www.e-codices.ch/en/about/webapplication)

and the dfg-viewer <http://dfg-viewer.de/en/regarding-the-project/> 
which is technically not very advanced but based  on the widely 
distributed METS data format <http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/> which 
gives you the possibility to exchange the viewer to any other capable of 
handling METS data and that certainly should be an option for a long 
term project.

Best
