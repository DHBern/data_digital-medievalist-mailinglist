[Please excuse us for the cross mailings].

Dear all,

There are only one week left to respond to the call for proposals, and we look forward to receiving your proposals:

Our call for papers for the conference "Ancient documents and automatic recognition of handwriting" to be held on 23 and 24 June 2022 at the Ã‰cole nationale des chartes in Paris is still open.

This conference will address the theme of HTR while linking it to scientific issues of corpus constitution and/or exploitation.

We wish to question the practical aspects of the use of this technology (development of HTR engine, transcription interface, user interface to use and train models, etc.), while raising its methodological issues and its impact on research data.

You can send us your proposals until 28 February via the dedicated platform. Proposals should be between 750 and 1000 words (excluding bibliography and illustrations). They can be made in French or in English.

You will find the full call for proposals at the following address: https://dahtr.sciencesconf.org.

Please feel free to share this information,

Yours sincerely,

Ariane Pinche for the organising committee
