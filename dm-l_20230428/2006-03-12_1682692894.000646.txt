Subject: [dm-l] digitalmedievalist@uleth.caDear all,For almost a year, we have been suffering from a serious spam problem at
_redacted_(a)uleth.ca (250+ spam per
day). We've not been able to filter the spam internally as well as we'd
like due to some constraints that I won't bother you with, but show the
weakness of bureaucracy.We seem, finally, to have solved the problem. Unfortunately, in this
time we have undoubtedly missed some legitimate emails despite our best
_redacted_(a)uleth.ca and have not
received a reply, it is almost certainly because you have been mistaken
as spam. I do not think we have let a legitimate, recognised, email go
unanswered for more than 48 hours.We are currently going through the trap to find missed messages.
However, if you have emailed us and have not received a response, please
let me ask you to try us again. In order to check that the spam filter
really is working (we've had it up for four days), let me ask you to cc
_redacted_(a)uleth.ca directly on any messages you sent to
_redacted_(a)uleth.ca so I know they've been sent.Sorry again for any trouble our spam problems may have caused you. I am
happy to report that they really do seem to be fixed.-d--
