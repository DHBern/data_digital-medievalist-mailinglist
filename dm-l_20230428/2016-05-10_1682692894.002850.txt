Subject: [dm-l] Greg Crane Lecture Tour

These events will probably also be of interest to [digital] 
Mediaevalists in the UK (with apologies for cross posting).

-------- Forwarded Message --------
The School of Advanced Study, London sponsors an S T Lee Visiting 
Professorial Fellowship. This year it is held by Greg Crane, Humboldt 
Professor of the Humanities at the University of Leipzig. During May and 
June he will be lecturing and holding events around the UK on the theme 
*Greek, Latin and Digital Philology in a Global Age*

The opening event 
(http://www.sas.ac.uk/support-research/public-events/2016/global-philology-greco-roman-studies-and-classics-21st-century) 
will be take place at the ICS (Senate House, room 349) on 17th May, 5.30 
and will be a round table discussion with Dr Imre Galambos (Cambridge), 
Professor Eleanor Robson (UCL), Dr Sarah Savant (Aga Khan University), 
Dr Michael Willis (British Museum) and will explore the question of what 
Classics can realistically mean in a century where China, India (with 
its six official Classical languages), and the various nations of the 
Arabic and Persian-speaking world play an active role in shaping global 
cultures. It will be followed by a reception.

All are welcome.
