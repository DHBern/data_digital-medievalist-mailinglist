Catching up on mail I scanned this thread briefly, and don't think I saw 
a reply to this question? This is where the transcription is: 
http://www.let.ru.nl/dierenpalleys/. What has been transcribed is a 
printed (in 1520) animal encyclopedia in Dutch. (The site is horribly 
slow right now).

An initiative that I don't believe was mentioned in the thread is 
Wikisource, one of Wikipedia's sister projects. 'Wikisource is an online 
library of free content publications, collected and maintained by our 
community' (http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page). Especially the 
German wikisource (http://de.wikisource.org/) has developed strict 
procedures and guidelines for transcription. It contains a sizable 
amount of medieval material, some of it transcribed from earlier print 
editions, some from digitised originals.

Personally, however, I don't think wiki is appropriate technology for 
this type of work (except, perhaps, as a first step).
