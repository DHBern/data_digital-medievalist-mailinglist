Subject: [dm-l] dtd/schema generators?

Hi,
There used to be a very good (free) dtd and schema generator at
http://www.hitsw.com/xml_utilites/. This site allowed you to upload an
xml file and produce a rough Document Type Definition (dtd) or Schema
file that was suitable for tweaking. I used it as recently as this past
April, but it doesn't seem to be there any more. Does anybody know of an
equivalent?
