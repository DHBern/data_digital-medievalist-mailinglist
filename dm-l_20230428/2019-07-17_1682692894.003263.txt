Archeometric analysis of inks from Coptic manuscripts

The main aim of this research project is to record the technological evolution of writing inks in early Christian Egypt. We aim at reconstructing a geo-chronological map displaying the types of ink used in different areas. Our multi-analytical approach consists of different imaging and spectroscopic techniques to detect the composition of black and coloured inks. Once enough data have been collected, we will be able to place in time and space unknown manuscripts. In the meanwhile, our work supports palaeographic and codicological studies, helping distinguish different writing phases on a manuscript or in the reconstruction of ancient libraries.
