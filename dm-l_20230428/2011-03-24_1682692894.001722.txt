Subject: [dm-l] advice for student?

Hi everyone!  I met a photography undergrad here who is doing a 
paper/presentation on medieval manuscripts for a class and we started talking 
about the wonders of ms. digitization, about which she is keenly interested.  
Does anyone have advice to share with her about how to get started on this road 
(programs, etc)?  Thank you in advance for any assistance that you might be able 
to share!

Cheers,
~w.
